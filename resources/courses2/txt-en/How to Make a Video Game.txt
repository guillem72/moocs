In this course, you'll learn how to make a video game. If you've never programmed before, this is the place to start. You'll create a video game for Windows and Mac OS X where the player must hop a frog character around a swamp to collect flies. Meanwhile, a predatory bird chases the player around. You'll learn about the Unity game engine and the C# programming language, which will allow us to write the code to make the game run. Each line of code will be explained step-by-step, so even if you have no prior experience, you'll be able to learn and follow along.By the end, you'll have a fun video game that you can share with other people.
