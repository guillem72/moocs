Computer Science Do you want to become a better problem solver? This Java course will provide you with a strong understanding of basic Java programming elements and data abstraction using problem representation and the object-oriented framework. As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” This course will use sample objects such as photos or images to illustrate some important concepts to enhance understanding and retention. You will learn to write procedural programs using variables, arrays, control statements, loops, recursion, data abstraction and objects in an integrated development environment. This course is comprised of two 5-week parts. Part 1 introduces programming fundamentals. Problem solving Primitive data types and arithmetic expressions Object-oriented programming basics Branching and Loops Arrays Part 2 covers the following topics. String manipulation File I/O Simple event-driven programming Recursion Abstract data types At the end of the course, you will be able to: Take a “real-life” problem and abstract out the pertinent aspects necessary to solve it in an algorithmic manner. Formulate formal solutions to well-defined problems using the logic of a programming language. Implement formal solutions in Java using an integrated development environment. Understand the basics of data abstraction using the object-oriented framework.
