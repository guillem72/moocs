People in the health sciences profession rely on regression modeling to gain insight on make decisions based on a continuous flow of response data.Focusing on linear and multiple regression, this course will provide theoretical and practical training&nbsp;in statistical modeling.This is a hands-on, applied course where students will become proficient at using computer software to analyze data drawn primarily from the fields of medicine, epidemiology and public health.There will be many practical examples and homework exercises in this class to help you learn.&nbsp;If you fully apply yourself in this course and complete all of the homework, you will have the opportunity to master methods of statistical modeling when the response variable is continuous and you will become a confident user of the Stata* package for computing linear, polynomial and multiple regression.*Access to Stata will be provided at no cost for the duration of this course. This course was developed in partnership with the Centre Virchow-Villermé for Public Health Paris-Berlin, a bi-national centre of the Université Sorbonne Paris Cité and Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Special support was contributed from the Université Paris Descartes that also belongs to the community of Université Sorbonne Paris Cité. Regression modeling is the standard method for analysis of continuous response data. This course provides theoretical and practical training in statistical modeling with particular emphasis on linear and multiple regression.
