Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence Week 1: Introduction and Planning in Context Week 2: State-Space Search: Heuristic Search and STRIPSWeek 3: Plan-Space Search and HTN Planning One week catch up break Week 4: Graphplan and Advanced Heuristics Week 5: Plan Execution and Applications Exam week The January 2015 session&nbsp;was the final version of the course. It will remain open so that those interested can register and access all the materials. The course aims to provide a foundation in artificial intelligence techniques for planning, with an overview of the wide spectrum of different problems and approaches, including their underlying theory and their applications. It will allow you to: Understand different planning problems Have the basic know how to design and implement AI planning systems Know how to use AI planning technology for projects in different application domains Have the ability to make use of AI planning literature Planning is a fundamental part of intelligent systems. In this course, for example, you will learn the basic algorithms that are used in robots to deliberate over a course of actions to take. Simpler, reactive robots don't need this, but if a robot is to act intelligently, this type of reasoning about actions is vital.
