Yet hidden in the three billion nucleotides of your genome is a secret language. This course offers an introduction to how we can start to understand this language by using algorithms to find hidden messages in DNA.What do these hidden messages say? &nbsp;In the first chapter of the course, hidden DNA messages indicate where a bacterium starts replicating its genome, a problem with applications in genetic engineering and beyond. In the second chapter, hidden DNA messages tell us how organisms know whether it is day or night as well as how the bacterium causing tuberculosis is able to hide from antibiotics. We will see how randomized algorithms, which toss coins and roll dice, can be used to find these messages.Each of the two topics in the course builds the algorithmic knowledge required to address this challenge. In the end of the course, you will be able to apply popular bioinformatics software tools for finding regulatory motifs in experimental data sets and solve our Bioinformatics Application Challenge. This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat. After warming up our algorithmic muscles, we will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to real experimental datasets.
