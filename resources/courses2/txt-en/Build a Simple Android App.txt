This project covers the very basics of Android development. We will build a simple app that will serve up some fun facts when you tap on a button. We introduce the Java programming language, a tool for Android development called Android Studio, and some very basic concepts of the Android Software Development Kit, or SDK. By the end you will have a good idea of how a basic app works, and you will be armed with the knowledge to start building more.
