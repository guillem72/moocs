Mathematics Week 1: Topology; continuity and convergence of a sequence in a topological space.Week 2: Metric and normed spaces; completenessWeek 3: Banach spaces; linear continuous functions; weak topologyWeek 4: Hilbert spaces; The Riesz representation theoremWeek 5: The Lax-Milgram LemmaWeek 6: Properties of the Lp spacesWeek 7: Distributions and Sobolev SpacesWeek 8: Application: simulating a membrane Functional analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with spaces of functions. It is a valuable tool in theoretical mathematics as well as engineering. It is at the very core of numerical simulation. In this class, I will explain the concepts of convergence and talk about topology. You will understand the difference between strong convergence and weak convergence. You will also see how these two concepts can be used. You will learn about different types of spaces including metric spaces, Banach Spaces, Hilbert Spaces and what property can be expected. You will see beautiful lemmas and theorems such as Riesz and Lax-Milgram and I will also describe Lp spaces, Sobolev spaces and provide a few details about PDEs, or Partial Differential Equations.
