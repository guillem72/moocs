Learn all the ins and outs of Yosemite, Apple's Mac OS X 10.10 operating system. Staff author Nick Brazzi starts with a tour of the core interface elements—the menus, Finder, and Dock—so you can start working with files, folders, and applications right away. He then shows how to save files and find them again quickly, as well as use the core applications that come bundled with Yosemite (Mail, Calendar, iMessage, iTunes, and Safari), and install new apps from the Apple Store. Finally, the course explores sharing over a network, and backing up your system, manually or with Time Machine, so you don't lose any important data.
