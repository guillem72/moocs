What is the cloud? If you have trouble answering this question, you're not alone. In this course, we'll explore how the cloud works, what drives its incredible growth, and how you can use cloud services. And don't worry if you're not tech-savvy! We'll relate the cloud to things you encounter every day, using practical, non-technical language. We'll start by looking at the building blocks of the cloud, where it started, and how it transitioned from an experiment into an unstoppable force. You'll also gain a clear understanding of IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS, and see why each may be attractive to some businesses, but not others. And you'll learn about the different kinds of clouds (public, private, and hybrid). We'll also take an inside look at the engine rooms of the cloud: data centers. You'll examine the concept of big data?the overwhelmingly huge amounts of data that make analysis so challengingâ€”and how the cloud infrastructure enables data to zip across the globe at lightning speed. Social networking has also played an incredibly important role in the growth of the cloud. We'll examine how Facebook and Twitter contribute to the cloud, and how apps go from idea to app store. You'll gain an understanding of how mobile devices and major mobile ecosystems?like Apple, Android, and Windows?continue to shape the cloud, and how start-ups can use social media to shake things up like never before. So come see how the how the cloud can work for you! Whatever your technical background, by the end of this course, you'll be thoroughly cloud-savvy.
