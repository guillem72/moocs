Computer Science Course Syllabus Module 1: Overview and Requirements Specifications Introduction to real-time systems. Specifying real-time systems.  Module 2: Operating Systems and Building Real-Time Systems What is so special about real-time systems? How are real-time operating systems constructed?  This computer science course provides an overview on designing and analyzing real-time operating systems (RTOS). Found in most mission critical and infrastructure systems, real-time systems are both challenging and rewarding to build.  Derived from the course instructor’s ground-breaking text on the subject, learn about real-time systems from one of the leading educators in the field. A minimum understanding of computing principles at a high school level is suggested. Join us as we adventure into the world of real-time systems. What is so different and special about real-time systems Unique challenges in the requirements and specifications for real-time systems Introduction to real-time operating systems design An overview of how to build real-time systems
