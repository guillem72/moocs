Mathematics This course is a first taste of multivariable calculus, but viewed&nbsp;through the lens of linear algebra. Introducing matrices (and linear&nbsp;transformations!) permits us to share a more coherent story about&nbsp;multivariable differential calculus.Week 1: Multiple variablesWeek 2: Limits and derivativesWeek 3: The chain ruleWeek 4: Second derivativeWeek 5: OptimizationWeek 6: Higher derivatives M2O2C2 is an invitation to think carefully about how one thing changing&nbsp;affects something else. What is the "derivative" of a function of many&nbsp;variables? How can a curved object be approximated by a flat plane? What&nbsp;does the chain rule look like when many things are affecting many other&nbsp;things? How do we find an input which maximizes a function of many&nbsp;variables?This is a first course in multivariable differential calculus, but along&nbsp;the way, we will also introduce a ton of linear algebra. The result is a&nbsp;course targeted at a student who has seen a bit of calculus and who is&nbsp;willing to learn about linear transformations&nbsp;and vectors; such a&nbsp;student will have the best possible vantage point from which to explore&nbsp;derivatives of functions of many variables. M2O2C2 provides a first taste of multivariable differential calculus. By introducing the machinery of linear algebra, this course provides helpful tools for understanding the derivative of a function of many variables.
