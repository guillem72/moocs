This ambitious hands-on, step-by-step course by Dr Alex Davidovic takes you from your first programming steps to becoming a JavaScript guru. The material is divided into bite-size chunks, and as soon as you master the programming fundamentals, the building blocks and the ways to control the program flow, you start "swimming in the deep water" and take aim at the advanced concepts such as recursion (a function calling itself) and working with objects. You learn how toÂ animate text and images, capture the mouse, keyboard and other events, direct the execution of the program, and more.
