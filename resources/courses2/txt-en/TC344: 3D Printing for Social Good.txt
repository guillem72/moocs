3D printing is primed to change our physical world. Twenty years after the Internet and cell phones fundamentally changed how humans communicate with each other and exchange information, this new technology is set to revolutionize the way that we make products by bringing factory to the people and ushering in a new era of innovation and creativity in manufacturing. As 3D printers become more sophisticated and affordable and a number of patents expire, their potential to assist in response to global development and humanitarian challenges increases dramatically. Already 3D printers have been used to print low-cost soft-tissue prosthetics and medical supplies like customized tracheal valves, umbilical cord clamps, and splints. Efforts are underway to make it possible to print things like solar panels, greenhouses, dental implants, and more. This four-week online certificate course will explore case studies across a range of sectors from disaster response to health, to agriculture, and energy. It will attempt to address questions like: can 3D printing truly provide significant reductions in supply chain time and costs? How might it be introduced inclusively into communities so as not to augment the digital divide? How long before it can effectively benefit the worldâ€™s most marginalized individuals? The course will provide a basic introduction to the technical fundamentals of 3D printing and assist you in connecting with local maker spaces and 3D printing communities in your country. It will also consider various obstacles to adoption including: supply chain challenges, insufficient electricity and internet coverage; and legal issues related to intellectual property. All TechChange online courses provide a unique hands-on learning environment with animated videos, technology demos, practical activities, networking events, immersive simulations and more.
