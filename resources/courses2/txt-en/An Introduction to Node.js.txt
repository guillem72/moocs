Welcome! In this course, we’re going to take the knowledge that you’ve gained from coding for the browser and apply it to the server environment. Over the next fifteen lessons, we’ll start from the beginning (getting Node installed and running) and then move on to more complex projects that will explore the basic tools and functionality that the Node.js platform has to offer.
