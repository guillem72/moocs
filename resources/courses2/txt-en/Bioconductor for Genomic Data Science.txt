Computer Science: Theory, Statistics and Data Analysis Introduction to BioconductorIntroduction to common data structuresGetting data into BioconductorData analysis using BioconductorAnnotate your results using BioconductorVisualize your data using Bioconductor This class will provide an introduction to the Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/). The class will cover how to install and use Bioconductor software. We will discuss common data structures, including ExpressionSets, SummarizedExperiment and GRanges used across several types of analyses. Several popular packages for analysis and annotation of your data will be covered, including packages such as GenomicRanges, biomaRt, rtracklayer, AnnotationHub and others.&nbsp;This course has a $99 value but being offered at a significant discount. Learn to use tools from the Bioconductor project to perform analysis of genomic data. This is the fifth course in the Genomic Big Data Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.
