Engineering The Statics of Everyday Objects is a course about the world and how it reacts to the forces acting on it. From suspension bridges holding up miles of roadway, to sky-scraping buildings in the midst hurricanes, to huge dams retaining billions of gallons of water in a reservoir, these structures must withstand both the forces of nature and the forces that mankind has intended for them. The analytical tools that designers use to create these structures are deceptively simple, and it is the intent of this course to explain things in a clear, straightforward manner. The Statics of Everyday Objects is a course about how structures react to forces exerted on them while remaining unmoved.
