Mathematics, Information, Tech & Design Hypothesis TestingPower and sample size and two group testsTests for binomial proportionsTwo sample binomial tests, delta methodFisher's exact tests, Chi-squared testsSimpson's paradox, confoundingRetrospective case-control studies, exact inference for the odds ratioMethods for matched pairs, McNemar's, conditional versus marginal odds ratiosNon-parametric tests, permutation testsInference for Poisson countsMultiplicity This class presents fundamental concepts in data analysis and&nbsp;statistical inference, focusing on one and two independent samples.&nbsp;Students having taken this class should be able to summarize samples,&nbsp;perform relevant hypothesis tests and perform a collection of two&nbsp;sample comparisons. Classical non-parametric methods and discrete data&nbsp;analysis methods are discussed. &nbsp;The class is taught at a master's of&nbsp;biostatistics introductory level and requires Mathematical&nbsp;Biostatistics Boot Camp 1 as a prerequisite. Developed in collaboration with Johns Hopkins Open Education Lab. Learn fundamental concepts in data analysis and statistical inference, focusing on one and two independent samples.
