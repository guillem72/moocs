Data Analysis & Statistics Course Syllabus Week 1 – Introduction to Data Science Week 2 – Statistical Thinking Examples of Statistical Thinking Numerical Data, Summary Statistics From Population to Sampled Data Different Types of Biases Introduction to Probability Introduction to Statistical Inference  Week 3 – Statistical Thinking 2 Association and Dependence Association and Causation Conditional Probability and Bayes Rule Simpsons Paradox, Confounding Introduction to Linear Regression Special Regression Models Week 4 – Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization Goals of statistical graphics and data visualization Graphs of Data Graphs of Fitted Models Graphs to Check Fitted Models What makes a good graph? Principles of graphics Week 5 – Introduction to Bayesian Modeling Bayesian inference: combining models and data in a forecasting problem Bayesian hierarchical modeling for studying public opinion Bayesian modeling for Big Data This statistics and data analysis course will pave the statistical foundation for our discussion on data science. You will learn how data scientists exercise statistical thinking in designing data collection, derive insights from visualizing data, obtain supporting evidence for data-based decisions and construct models for predicting future trends from data. This is the first course in the three-part Data Science and Analytics XSeries. Data collection, analysis and inference Relationship between variables Types of association Conditional probability Bayes’ Rule Goals of data visualization Statistical comparisons that underlie data graphics How Bayesian inference is used to combine sources of information Identify situations where Bayesian modeling can be useful
