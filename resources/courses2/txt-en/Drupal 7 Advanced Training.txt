This course teaches web site designers how to take their sites to the next level with a few advanced techniques and the free and open-source Drupal software. Author Tom Geller shows how to configure the most popular add-on modules; use *nix commands and an FTP program to manage a Drupal site on a web server; change its visual appearance using the latest graphical tools; automate and speed through common tasks with Drush; integrate with social media sites; and see how "supermodules" like Panels, Context, Rules, and Features open up new worlds of code-free development. _Drupal 7 Advanced Training_ was designed as a follow-up to _[Drupal 7 Essential Training](http://www.lynda.com/tutorial/73655)_ and it also dovetails nicely with our other Drupal courses, such as _[Drupal 7 Reporting and Visualizing Data](http://www.lynda.com/tutorial/85758)_ and _[Create Your First Online Store with Drupal Commerce](http://www.lynda.com/tutorial/80587)_.
