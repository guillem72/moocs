Mathematics Week 1 - Limits and Continuity: limits of functions, asymptotic behavior, unbounded behavior, continuity properties of functions, the intermediate value theorem, limits of trigonometric functions and the extreme value theorem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessments: Practice Problems and Quizzes Week 2 - Derivatives of Polynomials and Trigonometric Functions, Chain Rule, Higher Order Derivatives, and Implicit Differentiation: definition and concept of the derivative, derivative rules, higher order derivatives,interpretation of the derivative, chain rule, implicit differentiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessments: Practice Problems and Quizzes Week 3 - Applications of the Derivative: related rates, velocity/acceleration, Mean Value Theorem, intervals of increase/decrease, extreme values, concavity, points of Inflection and curve sketching.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessments: Practice Problems and Quizzes Week 4 - Transcendental Functions: inverse functions, exponential and natural logarithm functions, inverse trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessments: Practice Problems and Quizzes Week 5 - Further Applications of the Derivative: optimization, differentials L'Hospital's Rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessments: Practice Problems and QuizzesWeek 6 - Practice AB Exam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessments: Two exams This course reviews the topics for the AP Calculus AB Exam.&nbsp; The course is divided into two parts.&nbsp; Part 1 is Differential Calculus and incorporates mostly AB topics but does have some BC topics.&nbsp; Part 2 is Integral Calculus, and again is mostly AB material.&nbsp; The BC material that is not covered in either of these parts will be reviewed in an extension. Each week&nbsp;of the six week review will include review videos for an important block of material, complete with&nbsp;videos of worked example problems and exam tips. There will also be an extensive&nbsp;online quiz given each week, with multiple problem versions that students can use to practice, along with practice tests to help students prepare for the AP* Calculus AB Exam. * AP Calculus is a registered trademark of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, this product.
