This course teaches you how to build a game using the 2D gaming framework in iOS called SpriteKit. We will take designs created in the Mobile Game Design course and bring them to life. The course will teach you fundamentals of game development like: scenes, nodes, animation, physics, collision, particle systems, sound, and more. You will also learn to incorporate some basic artificial intelligence to keep score and manage lives. Towards the end you will have a fully functional game called Space Cat that teaches everything you need to know to build a game of your own.
