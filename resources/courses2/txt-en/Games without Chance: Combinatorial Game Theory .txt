Mathematics Prerequisite KnowledgeThis is a university level Mathematics course. While there are no specific Mathematics prerequisites, it is highly recommended that students have taken rigorous college level Mathematics courses (AP calculus counts as such). Text and Resources Although the class is designed to be self-contained, students wanting to expand their knowledge beyond what we can cover in a one-quarter class can find a much more extensive coverage of this topic in the 4 volume work “Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays” by Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy. Grading PolicyThere will be one quiz each week for weeks 2 through 6 (no assignment week 1 or 7). A quiz will consist of a few problems, usually 4 or 5. Each question is worth 1 point each with no partial credit. All answers should be submitted to the Quizzes tab on the left by the deadline of the quiz. The deadline for a quiz will be Sunday at 11:59 PM EST (the end of the current week). Students will have until Monday at 11:59 PM EST to submit the quiz without a penalty, and until Wednesday at 11:59 PM EST to submit it with a 10% penalty per day late. A detailed solutions guide will be uploaded after the deadline. To pass the course, an overall score of 60% will be needed. To pass the course with distinction, an overall score of 85% will be needed.  This course explores the mathematical theory of two player games without chance moves. We will cover simplifying games, determining when games are equivalent to numbers, and impartial games. Many of the examples will be with simple games that may be new to you: Hackenbush, Nim, Push, Toads and Frogs, and others. While this probably won’t make you a better chess or go player, the course will give you a better insight into the structure of games. This course will cover the mathematical theory and analysis of simple games without chance moves.
