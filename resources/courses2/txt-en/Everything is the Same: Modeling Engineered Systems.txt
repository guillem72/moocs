Engineering Topics:1. What does it mean to model a physical system?2. Newton's laws3. Mechanical components connected together4. Chemical diffusion5. Laws governing electrical behavior6. Circuits and electrical components connected together7. Analogies between physical systems8. Diffusion is everywhere Students in this class will learn modeling and analysis techniques applicable to electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems.  This “systems” view, that focuses on what is common to these different physical systems, has been responsible for much of the progress in the last several decades in aeronautics, robotics, and other engineering disciplines where there are many different technologies working together.  Starting with algebraic descriptions of individual components (such as resistors), the class develops tools for modeling engineered systems.  Differential equations are key ingredients, so we will spend significant time learning how to derive differential equations from component descriptions.  One of the key ideas in this class is that electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems may seem very different from each other but often have very similar behavior, allowing us to draw powerful analogies between them.  Case studies from several areas of engineering will be used to illustrate the modeling techniques, including examples from robotics, power networks, exoskeletons, biomechanics, system identification, and active sensing.  Students will be encouraged to do hands-on experiments that demonstrate the techniques.  This introduction to engineering course will help you learn modeling and analysis techniques for electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems and discover how engineered systems that seem very different are actually very similar.
