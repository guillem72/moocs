Engineering This course will provide an introduction to Behavioral Imaging, a new research field which encompasses the measurement, modeling, analysis, and visualization of behaviors from multi-modal sensor data. It is tailored for undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in this emerging field. The course is designed to provide:A broad introduction to research questions in Behavioral Imaging (BI)An in-depth understanding of the key technologies for BIHands-on experience in working with relevant sensor data (video, audio, wearable)An overview of the psychology and neuroscience literature relating to behavior from a computational perspective, with a particular focus on disorders of development such as autism and behaviors implicated in chronic health conditions This course will provide an introduction to Behavioral Imaging, a new research field which encompasses the measurement, modeling, analysis, and visualization of behaviors from multi-modal sensor data.
