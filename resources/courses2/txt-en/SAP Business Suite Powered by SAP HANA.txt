With SAP HANA, SAP offers the first full in-memory platform in the cloud today, and has taken the lead in making the concept of a real-time enterprise a reality. SAP Business Suite powered by SAP HANA not only brings together transactions and analytics on a single in-memory platform; it completely redefines the concept of real time (which the ‘R’ in R/1, R/2 and R/3 has always stood for). It enables business processes be re-thought, drives real-time business transformation, and generates customer value both for business and IT.
