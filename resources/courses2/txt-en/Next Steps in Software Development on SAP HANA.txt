SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform that is deployable either as an appliance or in the cloud. At its core, it is an innovative, in-memory, relational database management system that exploits all the capabilities of current hardware to increase application performance, reduce total cost of ownership, and enable new scenarios and applications that were not possible before.SAP HANA enables you to build applications that integrate the business logic, the control logic, and the database layer with unprecedented performance. As a developer, one of the key issues is how to minimize data movements. The more you can do directly on the data in memory next to the CPUs, the better the application will perform.This course will build upon last yearâ€™s Introduction to Software Development on SAP HANA course and go deeper into each of the major topics around SAP HANA native development. We will explore the many advances in the programming model and tooling that came with SAP HANA SPS6, SPS7, and SPS8. During the course, we will use SAP HANA studio as well as several new Web- based tools (for example, the Web-based Development Workbench, SAP HANA Lifecycle Management, and SAP HANA XS Administration Tool). We will also go well beyond the basics of each of the programming models, allowing discussion of deeper, real-world patterns and anti-patterns. We will look at the architecture of applications that are not just read-only or analytic but also transactional or provide an interface with transactional systems. We will also look at the extended capabilities of SAP HANA, from beyond a database to a complete application platform.Registration, learning content, final exam, and Record of Achievement are free of charge. However, to fully benefit from the course, you can access a fee-based system environment to develop your own code.
