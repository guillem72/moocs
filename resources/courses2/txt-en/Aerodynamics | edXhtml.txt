Engineering XSeries Program Overview The Aerodynamics XSeries takes learners from the fundamentals of fluid mechanics to their application in aerodynamics. Learners gain a conceptual understanding of critical fluid dynamic phenomena from boundary layers to shock waves, and develop a firm foundation in the aerodynamic methods used to analyze and design modern aircraft. The concepts learned are relevant to other areas including wind turbines, hydrodynamics, and even bird flight. The Aerodynamics XSeries is appropriate for students with a solid background in mechanics, vector calculus, and differential equations.
