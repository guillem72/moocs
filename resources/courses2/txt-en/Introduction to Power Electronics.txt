Engineering Introduction to power electronics I. Converters in Equilibrium Principles of steady-state converter analysisSteady-state equivalent circuit modeling, losses, and efficiencySemiconductor power switch realizationThe discontinuous conduction modeConverter circuits and transformer isolationII. Converter Dynamics and ControlAC equivalent circuit modelingConverter transfer functionsController design The course is an introduction to switched-mode power converters. It provides a basic knowledge of circuitry for the control and conversion of electrical power with high efficiency. These converters can change and regulate the voltage, current, or power; dc-dc converters, ac-dc rectifiers, dc-ac inverters, and ac-ac cycloconverters are in common use. Applications include electronic power supplies, aerospace and vehicular power systems, and renewable energy systems. The course is an introduction to switched-mode power converters.
