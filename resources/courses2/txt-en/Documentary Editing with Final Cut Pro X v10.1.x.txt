Learn how to build a polished documentary using Final Cut Pro X 10.1.x and a few essential editing techniques. Author Diana Weynand demonstrates documentary editing in a real-world project, breaking down the process into a series of manageable steps and milestones. After reviewing existing footage, explore how to build and define a narrative, assemble rough cuts, and create motion graphics. Then see how to adjust B-roll shots, incorporate color correction and audio mixing techniques, and export the final movie. This course is part of a series that looks at documentary editing from the point of view of three different editors in three different editing applications. For more insight on editing documentary projects, take a look at _[Documentary Editing with Avid Media Composer](http://www.lynda.com/Avid- Media-Composer-tutorials/Documentary-Editing-Avid-Media- Composer/105362-2.html)_ and _[Documentary Editing with Premiere Pro](http://www.lynda.com/Premiere-Pro-tutorials/Documentary-Editing-Premiere- Pro/105388-2.html)_. Note: This course was updated to reflect the changes in the Final Cut Pro X v10.1.x update. Although the course was not re-recorded from scratch, we updated each of the movies by adding text overlays to guide you through existing changes. We also updated the exercise files to work with the most current version of the software.
