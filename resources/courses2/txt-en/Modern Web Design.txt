Go from project brief to mock-up. It’s impossible to deny the influence of great design on the web. It lets us build clear, focused products. And if becoming a designer interests you, this course is for you. You’ll learn that design is a methodical approach to problem solving and how to apply it to real-world problems. You'll gain experience from day one. Starting with creating user stories to understand customers and exploring concepts like color theory, typography, and visual hierarchy. As with all Thinkful courses, you’ll practice new concepts and hard skills (like Photoshop) by digging into projects that build your portfolio. At each step you'll have an experienced designer by your side to help you tackle difficult design decisions.
