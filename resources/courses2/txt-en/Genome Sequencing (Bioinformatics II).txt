Yet the problem is even more complex than it may appear ... to solve it, we will need to travel back in time to meet three famous mathematicians, and learn about algorithms based on graph theory.Later in the course, we will see that sequencing genomes is not the only task related to decoding biological macromolecules.&nbsp; Another difficult problem is sequencing antibiotics, short mini-proteins engineered by bacteria to fight each other.&nbsp; Even though antibiotics often contain fewer than 10 amino acids, sequencing them is a formidable challenge.&nbsp;Decoding the sequence of amino acids making up an antibiotic is an important biomedical problem, but the practical barriers to sequencing short antibiotics are often more substantial than barriers to assembling a genome with millions of&nbsp; nucleotides! To address this computational challenge, we will learn about brute force algorithms that often succeed in various bioinformatics applications.Finally in this course, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to assemble a deadly Staphylococcus bacterium. You will also be introduced to the popular cloud service BaseSpace offered by Illumina, the leading DNA sequencing company, thus joining the thousands of biologists and bioinformaticians who use BaseSpace every day. Biologists still cannot read the nucleotides of an entire genome as you would read a book from beginning to end. However, they can read short pieces of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces. We will further learn about brute force algorithms and apply them to sequencing mini-proteins called antibiotics. Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to sequence the genome of a deadly Staphylococcus bacterium.
