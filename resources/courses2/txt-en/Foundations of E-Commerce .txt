In the 6th and final week, participants observe how these concepts apply to different contexts.&nbsp; These contexts are case studies of multiple companies. Actual class discussions are shown to illustrate how the concepts can be used to understand and predict IT-driven transformations. The aim of this course is to understand issues that companies need to address when moving from being offline to online and learn how companies can craft business models where IT is embedded as an integral part of products, processes and customer interactions.
