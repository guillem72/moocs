By highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and industries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing from happening to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the study of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches to disruptions that actually work.&nbsp; Our ultimate objective is to develop a strategy for survival in a world confronting one disruptive technology after another. The purpose of this course is to help participants and the organizations they encounter survive the waves of technological disruptions facing business, government, education and their daily lives.
