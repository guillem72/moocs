The first iOS programming alternative to Objective-C, Swift is a clean, accessible, object-oriented language, with built-in support for modern programming features like closures, generics, and tuples. The main stumbling block for new Apple developers has always been the Objective-C language, which many developers find overly complex. Here Simon Allardice explores Swift's core syntax—variables, data types, functions, and control structures—and its object-oriented classes, via playgrounds, the innovative coding interface that allows you to see the results of your code instantly. He also introduces key concepts that lie at the heart of Swift and the best practices that are already developing around it. Plus, learn how to take Swift further, with advanced operators and features like protocols, generics, and extensions. Whether you're looking for a new language or for a place to enter the iOS/OS X development world, you're going to love Swift.
