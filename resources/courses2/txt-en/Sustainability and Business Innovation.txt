Conducting business in more sustainable ways is becoming increasingly relevant today and a “must-have” in the future. The sustainability megatrend is driven by a growing population, accelerating urbanization, resource intensity, government regulation, climate change, and – most importantly – by the fact that consumers are increasingly demanding healthy, affordable, as well as socially and environmentally responsible products. Organizations react by implementing more sustainable practices to grow their business, to attract the best talent and to remain relevant to their investors. But what does “sustainability” mean in a business context exactly? How are sustainable strategies crafted? How are they put into action? And finally, what is the role of information technology in all of this?
