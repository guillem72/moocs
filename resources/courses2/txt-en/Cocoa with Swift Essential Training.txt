Cocoa and Swift make a great team for building apps. Cocoa is the framework in which Mac OS X itself is written, and Swift is the new language that makes working with Cocoa classes and APIs easier than ever before. Here Todd Perkins walks you through the steps to creating Mac applications with this powerhouse combo. He'll take you through the basic concepts behind Cocoa, Swift, and the development environment known as Xcode, and then go straight into development. Learn how to create interface elements and connect them to code, work with bindings and key-value coding, and debug your applications and submit them to the Apple Store.
