Engineering Optional Pre-work: Synthetic Biology Primer Week 1: History of Recombinant DNA Week 2: Gain-of-Function Research Week 3: Biofuels Week 4: Environmental Remediation Week 5: Human Health Week 6: Governance Synbio is a diverse field with diverse applications, and the different contexts (e.g., gain-of-function research, biofuels) raise different ethical and governance challenges.&nbsp;The objective of this course is to increase participantsâ€™ awareness and understanding of ethical and policy/governance issues that arise in the design, conduct and application of synthetic biology. The course will begin with a short history of recombinant DNA technology and how governance of that science developed and evolved, and progress through a series of areas of application of synbio.&nbsp; Content will be presented in many forms, including not only reading and lectures, but also recorded and live interviews and discussions with scientists, ethicists and policy makers. Learners will have the opportunity to think, write and talk about the issues and challenges in their own work and in real-life case examples. A final project will engage students in the development of governance models for synbio. Learn about the ethics and policy issues that arise in the science and application of synthetic biology, from bioremediation to medicine.
