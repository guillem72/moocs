Engineering An overview to the state of the art of interactive data visualization in healthcare. The course will cover data visualization principles, methods, and techniques. Students will understand the wide variety of data visualizations and know what visualizations are appropriate for various types of data and for different goals; learn how how data visualizations use dynamic interaction methods to help users understand data; learn to apply an understanding of human perceptual and cognitive capabilities to the design of data visualizations; develop skills in critiquing different visualization techniques in the context of user goals and objectives; and understand how to design and implement data visualizations.
