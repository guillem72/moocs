â€žIn-Memory Data Management" focuses on the management of enterprise data in column-oriented in-memory databases. Latest hardware and software trends led to the development of a new revolutionary database technology that enables flexible and lightning-fast analysis of massive amounts of enterprise data. The basic concepts and design principles of this technology are explained in detail. Beyond that, the implications of the underlying design principles for future enterprise applications and their development are discussed. The course will explain in detail the differences and advantages of an in-memory column- oriented database in contrast to traditional row-oriented disk-based storages. The following topics are covered (among others): * Requirements for Modern Enterprise Computing, Enterprise Application Characteristics * Hardware Trends, Columnar Storage vs. Row Storage * Dictionary Encoding, Compression * Scans, Selects, Deletes, Inserts, Updates * Indices, Joins * Applications
