Computer Science: Theory, Statistics and Data Analysis Introduction to Programming Numbers and Strings Variable types String Functions Data input and output Data structures Lists Tuples Sets Dictionaries Controls and Repetitions Defining and Using Functions Modules and Packages Reading and Writing Files Interfacing with External Programs Biopython This class will provide an introduction to the Python programming language to people who are not computer scientists but who want to analyze genomic data. The course will teach participants basic concepts of bioinformatics programming, and introduce them to computational tools that deal with large amounts of data. The goals of the class is to enable students to write basic programs in Python, to adapt existing programs to their needs, and to interface Python programs with various bioinformatics packages through the use of Biopython.&nbsp;This course has a $99 value but being offered at a significant discount. This class provides an introduction to the Python programming language and the iPython notebook. This is the third course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.
