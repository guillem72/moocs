In this course, explore a powerful round-trip workflow between Avid Media Composer and Pro Tools to quickly mix dialogue, sound effects, and music for film. Author Scott Hirsch frames the lessons in a way that appeals to filmmakers of all levels, as well as professional and amateur audio mixers. He starts with exporting your tracks from Media Composer and taking advantage of the film and video-specific templates in Pro Tools, which makes project setup a snap. Then discover how to consolidate and edit dialog, fix noise problems and background hum, and add special effects. Finally, explore how to use automation and EQ to enhance and marry your final tracks to the picture.
