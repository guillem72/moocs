Fully integrated elastic audio was introduced in Pro Tools version 7.4 and gave editors the time-saving advantage of being able to change an audio file's tempo or timing in real time without the need to render the audio. In _Pro Tools Projects: Time Manipulation with Elastic Audio_, author Brian Lee White shows how to adjust tempo, change pitch, and quantize audio tracks with elastic audio. This course covers auto-conforming audio loops and regions to a sessionâ€™s tempo, enabling elastic audio on tracks, and using the five elastic audio plug-ins to extract as much fidelity as possible from the source material. Exercise files are included with the course.
