In this course we will build an iPhone app that records a conversation between you and a friend, and then makes your voices sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This course will introduce you to iOS app development in Swift, a new programming language from Apple, and serves as your launching point into the [iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd003).
