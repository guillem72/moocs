Computer Science Basic concepts of computer programming are introduced starting with the notion of an algorithm. Emphasis is on developing the ability to write programs to solve practical computational problems. Topics include: Algorithms Elements of C/C++ programming languages Basic data types Sequential and conditional execution Iterative solutions Arrays, matrices and their applications Functions Sorting and searching Elements of string processing Introduction to pointers Basics of Software Engineering Structures File Processing Participants will get to read and understand many sample programs, and will have to write several on their own. This course deals with procedural programming, and attempts to inculcate good programming practices in a novice programmer. Learn to write C++ programs, compile, and execute using the gcc/simplecpp compiler How to inculcate good programming practices How to write programs and develop the ability to solve practical real world computational problems How to logically think and produce a solution (program)Â
