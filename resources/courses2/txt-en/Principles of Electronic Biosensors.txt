Electronics Course Syllabus Unit 1: Introduction to Nanobiosensors / Settling TimeUnit 2: Setting TimeUnit 3: SensitivityUnit 4: SelectivityUnit 5: Putting the Pieces Together This electronics course will focus on the physics of biomolecule detection in terms of three elementary concepts: response time, sensitivity, and selectivity. We will use potentiometric, amperometric, and cantilever-based mass sensors to illustrate the application of these concepts to specific sensor technologies. Learners in this course will be able to decide what sensors to make, appreciate their design principles, interpret measured results, and spot emerging research trends. This electronics course is the latest in a science and engineering series offered by the nanoHUB-U project, which is jointly funded by Purdue University and the National Science Foundation.Â  Rationale of electronic biosensors Essence of three types of electronic nanonbiosensors (i.e., potentiometric, amperometric, and cantilever-based sensors) Three essential metrics that define modern electronic sensors; detection time, sensitivity, and selectivity Physics of detection time that allows one to organize every available sensor in a systematic way Fundamental limits of detection of various classes of sensors Opportunities and challenges of integrating sensors in a system platform
