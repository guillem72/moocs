Annotation, Sharing, Publishing 6. Sequence Data Quality Control 7. ChIP-seq analysis with MACS 8. RNA-seq mapping and 9. assembly 9. Galaxy on the cloud 10. Installing your own Galaxy The Galaxy Project (http://galaxyproject.org/) provides user friendly software for producing reproducible genomic pipelines for data analysis. This class will introduce the Galaxy Software system all the way from getting an account to building, running, and sharing a reproducible analysis pipeline. This course has a&nbsp;$99 value but being offered at a significant discount. Learn to use the tools that are available from the Galaxy Project. This is the second course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization.
