Computer Science: Software Engineering, Information, Tech & Design, Computer Science: Theory, Engineering This course will be broken up into 5 weekly modules covering the following topics: Week 1: Orientation, Intro to Clouds, MapReduce Week 2: Gossip, Membership, Grids Week 3: P2P Systems Week 4: Key-Value Stores, Time and Ordering Week 5: Snapshots, Multicast, Paxos And there's more! There are 5 more weeks of topics in Cloud Computing Concepts: Part 2. Cloud computing systems today, whether open-source or used inside companies, are built using a common set of core techniques, algorithms, and design philosophies—all centered around distributed systems. Learn about such fundamental distributed computing "concepts" for cloud computing. Some of these concepts include: Clouds, MapReduce, key-value stores Classical precursors Widely-used algorithms Classical algorithms Scalability Trending areas And more!Understand&nbsp;how these techniques work&nbsp;inside today’s most widely-used cloud computing systems. Get your hands dirty using these concepts with provided homework exercises. In the&nbsp;optional programming track, implement some of these concepts in template assignments provided in C++ programming language.You will also watch interviews with leading managers and researchers, from both industry and academia. Learn core distributed computing concepts that underlie today’s and tomorrow’s cloud computing systems.
