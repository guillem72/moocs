Information, Tech & Design Week One -&nbsp;Foundations of the&nbsp;TechniCity Understand the foundations of the TechniCity and what it means to be a city planner.Week Two -&nbsp;Infrastructure for the&nbsp;TechniCityYou'll learn how sensors and networks are transforming our cities.&nbsp;Week Three -&nbsp;Engaging the&nbsp;TechniCity Through social networking and crowdsourcing platforms you'll learn how to engage in city building.Week Four -&nbsp;Entrepreneurial Urbanism&nbsp;You'll explore how open data initiatives, hack-a-thons, and urban prototyping festivals are creatively innovating our cities. Weeks Five &amp; Six -&nbsp;Analyzing the&nbsp;TechniCityFrom&nbsp;sentiment&nbsp;analysis to mashups, you'll experiment with analyzing data.Week Seven –&nbsp;Leading TechniCities&nbsp;Explore how cities across the globe are using Technology to advance their future.Week Eight-&nbsp;The Future of the TechniCity&nbsp;You'll engage in peer evaluation of your fellow classmates projects and participate in lively discussion around the future of the TechniCity. We are part of the 'TechniCity'. The increasing availability of networks, sensors and mobile technologies allows for new approaches to address the challenges that our cities face. The way we understand cities is undergoing sweeping transformation, right along with the analytical tools we use to design our cities and the communication tools we use to engage people. Absorbing, studying and understanding the role of technology from a critical viewpoint allows us to generate creative ideas for improving our cities.  This course begins by examining how our cities are changing. We then jump into how technology is used to engage with the public to support decision-making and the creative ways that every-day people are using technology to improve their cities.   Students will be examining tools for analyzing the city. Then we move into exploring the fascinating ways that cities are using real-time, technology. You'll hear from technological innovators and thought leaders about all of these topics. You will get to engage around a topic you are most interested in to create a project in your own city. We live in real-time, technologically enhanced cities. Explore the sweeping changes that our cities are undergoing as a result of networks, sensors, and communication technology.
