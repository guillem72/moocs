AJAX is an important front-end web technology that lets JavaScript communicate with a web server. It lets you load new content without leaving the current page, creating a better, faster experience for your web site's visitors. In this course, you'll learn how AJAX works and how you can use JavaScript to communicate with a web server. We'll use plain JavaScript as well as jQuery to create AJAX requests and use the response to dynamically update your web pages. Along the way, you'll build mini-projects to reinforce your learning. We wrap up the course with a small project, showing you how to apply what you've learned to pull images from Flickr and display them on your web site.
