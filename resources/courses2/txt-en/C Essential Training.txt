Widely used for both systems and application development, C is a powerful language at the heart of many more modern languages, like JavaScript and Objective-C. In this course, professor Isac Artzi dissects the anatomy of C, from data types, strings, and variables to simple functions. He'll show how these basic elements fit together in control structures like loops and if-else statementsâ€”where the real logic behind your code comes into play. Plus, learn how C organizes information into arrays and how you can manage memory resources with pointers. C is a great first step for new programmers, and a way to broaden and deepen your knowledge if you've already programmed for a while. Press Play to start learning.
