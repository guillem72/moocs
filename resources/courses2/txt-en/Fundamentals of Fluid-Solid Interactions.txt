Engineering Week 1&nbsp;:&nbsp; Dimensional analysis of fluid-solid couplingThe variety of fluid-solid couplingsDimensional analysis as a classification toolDimensionless numbers in fluid-solid interactions From dimensionless numbers to dimensionless equationsWeek 2&nbsp;: A solid with a still fluid. Low reduced velocitiesSmall motions and low reduced velocitiesFluid-added StiffnessNeglecting viscous effects Fluid-added mass. Week 3&nbsp;: A solid with any fluid. Dominant effects of viscosityFluid-added damping&nbsp;Combined effects of fluid viscosityMemory&nbsp; effects&nbsp;Fluid sloshing Coupling of&nbsp; fluid sloshing with solid dynamics Week 4 &nbsp;: Coupling with a fast flow.&nbsp;High reduced velocitiesFlow-induced static instabilities, or bucklingCoupled-mode flutter of airfoils. Week 5&nbsp;: Coupling with a slow flow. Intermediate reduced velocitiesFlutter on one mode Stall flutter of airfoils Galloping of bluff bodies Week 6&nbsp;: Coupling with any&nbsp; flow. The fluid conveying pipe as a reference model of coupling Coriolis dampingSolution for any flow velocityFrom one mode to two modesVortex-induced vibrationsLock-in as a case of coupled-mode flutter What is &nbsp;fluid-solid interactions&nbsp; ?&nbsp; It is what happens when the &nbsp;motions of a fluid and of a solid are somehow coupled. This happens&nbsp; all the time,&nbsp; around you when leaves flutter in the wind,&nbsp; inside you when your heart beats, above you when wings of a plane vibrate, under the sea... The idea behind this MOOC&nbsp; is to give you the basic tools to &nbsp;be able to predict and eventually mitigate &nbsp;&nbsp;things called &nbsp;flutter, galloping, sloshing, vortex-induced vibrations, added mass,&nbsp; to cite a few.&nbsp; We are going to consider &nbsp;any &nbsp;possible domains of applications&nbsp; such as civil engineering,&nbsp; aerospace engineering, nuclear engineering , ocean engineering, biomechanics and even food&nbsp; processing ! This is why we &nbsp;called the course “Fundamentals of Fluid Solid Interactions ”. There are so many phenomena and so many models &nbsp;that&nbsp; we &nbsp;&nbsp;need to work together on the basic mechanisms . If &nbsp;you want to see how fluid-solid interactions work,&nbsp; and be able to use that knowledge, join us ! Fluid-Solid Interactions happen when the motion of solids and fluids are coupled. The aim of the course is to give you the basic tools to be able to understand, predict and eventually mitigate these interactions.
