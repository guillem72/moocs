Computer Science: Software Engineering, Information, Tech & Design, Computer Science: Systems & Security, Statistics and Data Analysis Part 0: Introduction&nbsp; Examples, data science articulated, history and context, technology landscape Part 1: Data Manipulation at Scale Databases and the relational algebra&nbsp; Parallel databases, parallel query processing, in-database analytics&nbsp;MapReduce, Hadoop, relationship to databases, algorithms, extensions, languages &nbsp;Key-value stores and NoSQL; tradeoffs of SQL and NoSQL Part 2: Analytics Topics in statistical modeling: basic concepts, experiment design, pitfalls Topics in machine learning: supervised learning (rules, trees, forests, nearest neighbor, regression), optimization (gradient descent and variants), unsupervised learning Part 3: Communicating Results Visualization, data products, visual data analytics&nbsp; Provenance, privacy, ethics, governance&nbsp;Part 4: Special Topics Graph Analytics: structure, traversals, analytics, PageRank, community detection, recursive queries, semantic webGuest Lectures Commerce and research are being transformed by data-driven discovery and prediction. Skills required for data analytics at massive levels – scalable data management on and off the cloud, parallel algorithms, statistical modeling, and proficiency with a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms – span a variety of disciplines and are not easy to obtain through conventional curricula. Tour the basic techniques of data science, including both SQL and NoSQL solutions for massive data management (e.g., MapReduce and contemporaries), algorithms for data mining (e.g., clustering and association rule mining), and basic statistical modeling (e.g., linear and non-linear regression). Join the data revolution. Companies are searching for data scientists. This specialized field demands multiple skills not easy to obtain through conventional curricula. Introduce yourself to the basics of data science and leave armed with practical experience extracting value from big data. #uwdatasci
