Join author Barton Poulson as he introduces the R statistical processing language, including how to install R on your computer, read data from SPSS and spreadsheets, and use packages for advanced R functions. The course continues with examples on how to create charts and plots, check statistical assumptions and the reliability of your data, look for data outliers, and use other data analysis tools. Finally, learn how to get charts and tables out of R and share your results with presentations and web pages.
