The most popular and versatile language. Meet the language of choice across statistics, finance, web development and general scripting. In 2014, Python surpassed Java as the most popular introductory programming language at top-ranked university computer science departments. We use Python in our backend software at Thinkful because of its versatility. In this course, you'll build entire web apps in Flask while learning object-oriented programming, test-driven development (TDD) and how to host your work on Heroku. You'll start by building a couple of basic Python apps and learning best practices. Then learn to read and write data from spreadsheets and third party APIs. And finally how to work with relational databases, SQL, SQLite, PostgresSQL, and SQLAlchemy. All in Python and all with an experienced Python engineer like Joe Turner, who wrote this very course.
