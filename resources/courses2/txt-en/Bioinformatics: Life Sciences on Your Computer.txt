Bioinformatics brings together biology, math and computer science into a quickly emerging discipline that turns the computer into a scientific research lab. The relevance of bioinformatics extends to many disciplines, including health science, molecular biology, genetics, drug discovery, biochemistry, cell biology and education. Its impact is significant. Many scientific researchers with advanced degrees are going back to school to learn computer techniques that have become as essential to new discovery as pipettes and flasks.This course will introduce some important basic bioinformatics concepts while allowing for the adventurous to explore some topics in further depth if desired. What makes bioinformatics education exciting is that people of a variety of education levels can get started quickly, with just a computer and internet access.
