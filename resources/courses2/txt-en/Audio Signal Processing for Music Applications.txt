Information, Tech & Design, Engineering Week 1: Introduction; basic mathematics&nbsp;Week 2: Discrete Fourier transformWeek 3:&nbsp;Fourier transform propertiesWeek 4:&nbsp;Short-time Fourier transformWeek 5:&nbsp;Sinusoidal modelWeek 6:&nbsp;Harmonic modelWeek 7:&nbsp;Sinusoidal plus residual modelingWeek 8:&nbsp;Sound transformationsWeek 9:&nbsp;Sound/music descriptionWeek 10:&nbsp;Concluding topics; beyond audio signal processing Audio signal processing is an engineering field that focuses on the computational methods for intentionally altering sounds, methods that are used in many musical applications. We have put together a course that can be of interest and accessible to people coming from diverse backgrounds while going deep into several signal processing topics. We focus on a number of spectral processing techniques of relevance for the description and transformation of sounds, developing the basic theoretical and practical knowledge with which to analyze, synthesize, transform and describe audio signals in the context of music applications. The course is based on open software and content. The demonstrations and programming exercises are done using Python under Ubuntu, and the references and materials for the course come from open online repositories. We are also distributing with open licenses&nbsp;the software and materials developed for the course. In this course you will learn about audio signal processing methodologies that are specific for music and of use in real applications. You will learn to analyse, synthesize and transform sounds using the Python programming language.
