They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.The algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach will be hands-on, with six two week projects, each of which will involve implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender.In addition to topical lectures, this course includes interviews and guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry.Two Ways to Take this Course:This course is designed to support two different types of students and educational goals:Programming Track: &nbsp;Designed for students with significant programming and mathematics experience (see below), the programming track combines a conceptual and mathematical understanding of recommender systems with experience programming six different recommender systems projects. &nbsp;Students completing this travel will gain the skills needed to implement basic recommenders from scratch, and to use software libraries and tools to implement more advanced recommenders.Concepts Track: &nbsp;Students who are not experienced programmers, or who are primarily interested in understanding the concepts and techniques of recommender systems, without learning to program them, can choose to focus on the conceptual and mathematical content, skipping the programming projects and associated lecture content.&nbsp; Students in the concepts track are still expected to have significant familiarity with computing systems and college-level mathematics, but need not be accomplished programmers. &nbsp;We expect this track to be useful for tech-savvy marketing and business leaders, as well as engineering managers who may oversee but not directly develop recommender systems. &nbsp;We also hope it will be useful to those looking to understand recommender systems concepts without the workload associated with programming those systems.&nbsp; This course introduces the concepts, applications, algorithms, programming, and design of recommender systems--software systems that recommend products or information, often based on extensive personalization.
