In this course, author Anastasia McCune provides the basic building blocks a designer, even one whoâ€™s never touched Flash, needs to create animation projects or build a web presence. This course works for all Creative Suite versions of Flash and demonstrates how to create graphics, transform them to symbols, instantly move and morph objects with tweens, and incorporate text and audio. The final chapters address slightly more advanced topics such as adding links and play/pause controls to a project with ActionScript, as well as how to embed video into a Flash project.
