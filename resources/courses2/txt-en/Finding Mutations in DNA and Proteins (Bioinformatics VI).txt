In this chapter, we will learn about&nbsp;combinatorial pattern matching algorithms for finding these mutations, a task that doctors will eventually be able to carry out within minutes in order to find disease genes.We will then examine the problem of detecting subtle similarities that evade the traditional sequence comparison algorithms that we studied in "Comparing Genes, Genomes, and Proteins".&nbsp;Having efficient algorithms for comparing highly diverged sequences is important, since a single misaligned nucleotide can misclassify a protein and prevent biologists from inferring its function. &nbsp;We will consider a popular approach to sequence comparison based on an abstract machine called a Hidden Markov Model.In the end of the course, a Bioinformatics Application Challenge will let you apply real bioinformatics software to see how Hidden Markov Models are used for finding CG-islands, identifying the junctions between exons and introns, and for high-powered sequence alignment. In this class, we will compare DNA from an individual against a reference human genome to find potentially disease-causing mutations. We will also learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.
