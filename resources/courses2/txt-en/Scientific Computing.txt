Mathematics, Statistics and Data Analysis Investigate the flexibility and power of project-oriented computational analysis. Practice using this technique to resolve complicated problems in a range of fields including the physical and engineering sciences, finance and economics, medical, social and biological sciences. Enhance communication of information by creating visual representations of scientific data. This course is a survey of numerical solution techniques for ordinary and partial differential equations. Emphasis will be on the application of numerical schemes to practical problems in the engineering and physical sciences. Apply advanced MATLAB routines and toolboxes to solve problems. Review and practice graphical techniques for information presentation and learn to create visual illustrations of scientific results Investigate the flexibility and power of project-oriented computational analysis, and enhance communication of information by creating visual representations of scientific data.
