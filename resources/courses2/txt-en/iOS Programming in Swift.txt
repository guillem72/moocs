Go from idea to App Store. The App Store is the chosen platform for the world’s most ground-breaking developers: from Snapchat to Venmo, Words with Friends to Vine. They all came to iOS first. In 2014 Apple announced Swift, the language that will power all future apps on iOS. And best of all it's made just for beginners. In Thinkful's Swift course you’ll learn the fundamentals of iOS app development. Starting with the basics of Xcode and Swift programming, you'll go over view controllers and table views — the building blocks of all iOS apps. With 1-on-1 help from your mentor, a professional Swift developer, you'll complete eight projects over five packed units. This course is designed to teach anyone how to publish their first app to the App Store – it's perfect for coding beginners or those just new to Swift.
