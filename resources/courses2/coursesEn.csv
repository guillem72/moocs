"Case-Based Introduction to Biostatistics"	"Statistics and Data Analysis Module 1 (Weeks 1 &amp; 2) Question: What common background understanding do I need to get started in improving my ability to critically and quantitatively reason about health questions?Module 2 (Weeks 3 &amp; 4) Question: How do the average medical care costs for people with a major smoking-caused disease (MSCD) differ from those for people without MSCDs who are otherwise similar?Module 3 (Week 5) Question: What is the rate of infant survival during the first 26 weeks of life in southern Nepal and how does the rate of survival vary by infant’s gestational age, sex, or being a singleton versus twin birth? The course objective is to enable each student to enhance his or her quantitative
scientific reasoning about problems related to human health. Biostatistics
is about quantitative approaches - ideas and skills - to address bioscience
and health problems. To achieve mastery of biostatistics skills, a student
must “see one, do one, teach one.” Therefore, the course is organized to
promote regular practice of new ideas and methods.

The course is organized into 3 self-contained modules. Each module
except the first is built around an important health problem.&nbsp;The
first module reviews the scientific method and the role of experimentation
and observation to generate data, or evidence, relevant to selecting among
competing hypotheses about the natural world. Bayes theorem is used to
quantify the concept of evidence. Then, we will discuss what is meant by
the notion of “cause.”
&nbsp;
In the second module, we use a national survey dataset to estimate the
costs of smoking and smoking-caused disease in American society. The concepts
of point and interval estimation are introduced. Students will master the
use of confidence intervals to draw inferences about population means and
differences of means. They will use stratification and weighted averages
to compare subgroups that are otherwise similar in an attempt to estimate
the effects of smoking and smoking-caused diseases on medical expenditures.
In the final module, we will study what factors influence child-survival in Nepal using data from the Nepal Nutritional Intervention Study Sarlahi or NNIPPS. Students will estimate and obtain confidence intervals for infant survival rates, relative rates and odds ratios within strata defined by gestational period, singleton vs twin births, and parental characteristics.

"Modelling and Simulation using MATLAB"	"Modelling and Simulation using MATLAB Technical progress wouldn’t be possible
without modelling and simulation. They are starting point and basis in most
cases of research and development. Modelling and simulation make a particular
part or feature of the world easier to define, visualize, quantify and
understand. Both require identifying and selecting relevant aspects of a
situation in the real world and then using different types of models for
different aims and defining the best fitting model parameters. MATLAB is a
high-level programming language and an environment for numerical computation
and visualization. You can analyse data and create models for a wide range of
applications, including signal processing and communications, image and video
processing, control engineering and computational finance. In this course you
will learn the basics of modelling and simulation from an interdisciplinary
perspective. In addition, we will teach you how to develop models using MALTAB
and the block diagram environment Simulink. Why this MOOC is interdisciplinary
Scientific disciplines have their own ideas about specific types of modelling.
Such as conceptual models to better understand the subject, graphical models
to visualize the subject, operational models to operationalize and
mathematical models to quantify the subject. In this course, our experts from
three disciplines look at modelling concepts from various angles:
Technological view Economic perspective Importance of knowledge management.
Course Contents The course is divided in two sections. The first part (A)
teaches the basics and is mandatory to all participants. Within the second
part of the course (B) you have the opportunity to choose from a catalogue of
applications (MOOClets) to work on selected examples. Part A –
Interdisciplinary Introduction to modelling and simulation Modelling
Simulation Introduction to MATLAB concepts Building a business case Methods to
solve formal problems Knowledge management Introduction to Simulink Part B –
Selectable Applications of modelling and simulation (MOOClets) You can choose
three to five applications according to your preference and knowledge from the
following catalogue: Simulation of a water treatment plant Application
'modelling a business base' Application 'knowledge management' Control
engineering I – 'controlling Lego® NXT robots' Control engineering II – 'line
tracking with Lego® Segway' Control engineering III – 'a Segway – how does it
work?' Image processing I – ‘statistics for image processing and machine
learning’ Image processing II – 'a brief introduction to image processing'
Image processing III – ‘application of machine learning algorithms in a
nutshell' Quality measurement of video cameras (lenses and sensors) Acoustic
simulation of musical instruments … (further chapters are planned) Learning
with the MOOC During the term of the MOOC we will offer video lectures that
convey modelling and simulation step by step in a descriptive way. You will
exercise the issues in interactive tasks and weekly homework. The MOOC
platform is a networking tool. You can benefit from the peer-to-peer learning
and the forum within the course. While not required, we recommend creating
learning groups and to engage in the community. Experimentation and playful
learning are part of the MOOC. Learning Outcomes Students are acquainted with
the concepts of modelling and simulation from an interdisciplinary point of
view Students are able to implement and simulate models using MATLAB/Simulink
Depending on the selected applications in part B of the course students get
deeper know how in control engineering, image processing, machine learning,
business case modelling, knowledge management and simulation of a water
treatment plant. Enthusiastic students with only simple programming knowledge
get an understanding of the basic MATLAB programming. Workload Approx. 8-12

"e-Learning Ecologies"	"Information, Tech & Design This course is broken up into 8 weekly modules covering the following topics:

Week 1: Conceptualizing Learning
Week 2: Spatio-Temporal Dimensions of Learning (Ubiquitous Learning)
Week 3: Epistemic Dimensions of Learning (Active Knowledge Making)
Week 4: Discursive Dimensions of Learning (Multimodal Meaning)
Week 5: Evaluative Dimensions of Learning (Recursive Feedback)
Week 6: Social Dimensions of Learning (Collaborative Intelligence)
Week 7: Cognitive Dimensions of Learning (Metacognition)
Week 8: Diversity Dimensions of Learning (Differentiated Learning) For more than 3 decades we have heard educators and technologists making a case for the transformative power of technology in learning. However, despite the rhetoric, in many sites and many ways education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.

This course explores 7 affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning—transformative, 21st century learning:


Ubiquitous Learning
Active Knowledge Making
Multimodal Meaning
Recursive Feedback
Collaborative Intelligence
Metacognition
Differentiated Learning


These affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action.

"Computer Graphics"	"Computer Science Today, computer graphics is a central part of our lives, in movies, games, computer-aided design, virtual simulators, visualization and even imaging products and cameras.  This course teaches the basics of computer graphics that apply to all of these domains.
Students will learn to create computer-generated images of 3D scenes, including flybys of objects, make a real-time scene viewer, and create very realistic images with raytracing.  We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement.  Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes.  Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.CSE167x teaches the foundations of computer graphics. 

This course runs for 6 weeks and consists of four segments. Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:

Overview and Basic Math (Homework 0: 10% of grade)
	Transformations (Homework 1: 20% of grade)
	OpenGL and Lighting (Homework 2: 35% of grade)
	Raytracing (Homework 3: 35% of grade)
This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.

FAQ

What is the format of the class?

The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. 

Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.

Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.

Will the text of the lectures be available?

Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.

Do I need to watch the lectures live?

No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can "work ahead" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.

How much does it cost to take the course?

Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.

What computer system do I need for the course?

The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.

Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?

This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.

Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?

Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.

I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?

In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.

I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?

The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.

"Systematic Program Design - Part 1: The Core Method"	"Computer Science Course Syllabus
        Syllabus

This is a full university course broken into three parts:

In Part 1 you will learn the core design method with a focus on simple data. In this part of the course, we introduce the idea of structuring a program based on the data it consumes. This part concludes with the design of simple interactive programs. The final project is an interactive game.

In Part 2, the focus is on more elaborate forms of data that can be used for more complex information. You will learn when and how to structure data using lists and trees. The final project will be a more elaborate interactive game in which more complex data structures are required.

In Part 3 you will learn about search, generative recursion, graphs and how to blend different kinds of structuring patterns together in more complex programs.  This part of the course concludes with a complex puzzle solving program project.

The course uses a small teaching language that includes the core features of nearly all other languages like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Java etc. Less than a week is required to learn nearly the whole language—the entire rest of the course is spent on program design. The focus on design together with the core nature of the language means that everything you learn will be applicable in any other language you use in the future. This programming course is unique in focusing on learning a design method rather than a programming language.  This practical method builds on years of research into the structure of good programs that will help you channel your creativity to program well in any language.

A primary challenge in programming is deciding exactly what our program should do. The first contribution of the design method is a set of techniques that help you systematically develop your program requirements. You will also learn to produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later. This is important because useful programs always require later improvements. In addition, you will learn how to make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process.

Online advertising, machine translation, natural language understanding, sentiment mining, personalized medicine, and national security are some examples of such AI-based web-intelligence applications that are already in the public eye. Others, though less apparent, impact the operations of large enterprises from sales and marketing to manufacturing and supply chains. In this course we explore some such applications, the AI/statistical techniques that make them possible, along with parallel implementations using map-reduce and related platforms.

This course was offered thrice during Fall 2012, Spring 2012 and Fall 2013; in Fall of both years it was also taken for credit at IIT Delhi and IIIT Delhi. During this period, I also wrote a book to elucidate the ideas discussed in the course at a 'popular' level:

The Intelligent Web: Search, Smart Algorithms and Big Data published by Oxford University Press, UK, in November 2013.

 Now in this edition, the course is being offered in 'self-study' mode. This course is about building 'web-intelligence' applications exploiting big data sources arising social media, mobile devices and sensors, using new big-data platforms based on the 'map-reduce' parallel programming paradigm. In the past, this course has been offered at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi as well as the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Algorithmic Thinking (Part 2)"	"Computer Science: Software Engineering, Computer Science: Theory Our course syllabus can be viewed at www.codeskulptor.org/coursera/algorithmicthinking.html. When presented with a problem from a scientific domain, a Computer Scientist goes through a set of steps in order to provide a solution for the problem. These steps include: (1) understanding the problem; (2) formulating the problem mathematically; (3) designing an algorithm; (4) implementing the algorithm; and (5) solving the original scientific problem. This course will train students in how to employ algorithmic thinking by following these five steps to solve real-world problems.&nbsp;Understanding the problem entails holding conversations with domain experts to understand the parameters of the problem, what data they can provide to the computer program, what answers they expect, etc. Formulating the problem mathematically is basically the step of turning the problem from an English description to a mathematical description that is amenable to further computational analyses.&nbsp;While the course emphasizes implementing the algorithms and solving the original problems that gave rise to the need for these algorithms in the first place, much of this two-part course (part 1 is available here) will be devoted to the third step, namely, algorithm design. Here, the course will introduce students to different algorithm design strategies, as well as mathematical tools for reasoning about the correctness and efficiency of algorithms. &nbsp; Experienced Computer Scientists analyze and solve computational problems at a level of abstraction that is beyond that of any particular programming language.  This two-part class is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of "Algorithmic Thinking", allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to computational problems." ,"Coursera"	"en"

FAQ

Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.

"Rethinking Ageing: Are we prepared to live longer?"	"Information, Tech & Design During the course you will have the opportunity to explore the following topics:
  Module one - Worldwide population ageing
  The course begins with module one, which looks at population ageing over the 21st century to better understand how to measure population ageing, the trends and data sources that are available in order to make evidence-based predictions.  You will explore available, reliable and free data sources on population ageing and use demographer tools to interpret data.
Module two - Lifelong participation
  We move from the population perspective covered in module one and consider your individual health status and the factors that influence how you age, such as type of work you do, your environment, current health conditions and daily activities.This module dives into the physical and psychological changes that are more common in later life and how the gains in technology advancements enable people to be active, independent and socially connected to support lifelong participation.
  Module three - Planning and design for an ageing population
By the middle of the course, we have moved beyond our individual selves to explore infrastructure and the spatial implications of ageing. This module highlights the planning and design principles for an age-friendly environment for transportation, housing, retirement communities and health care settings.
This module also showcases information technology software, such as mapping, data visualization and geospatial data to identify population trends and make data supported projections to optimally plan for ageing populations.
Module Four - Economics of ageing
The economic issues related to how to financially support living longer is challenging for government, communities, families and individuals. The module provides a framework to consider these challenges and potential strategies to address them.
Module Five - Ageing well
Lastly, we question whether the perceptions of ageing are changing – is 60 the new 40? What does this mean for intergenerational relationships, the value of older people, how we treat each other and how we can all age well in a sustainable way? Broad societal issues and ethical questions are raised in this module to consider what it means to 'age well.'
Modules six and seven are 100% dedicated to your final assessment and you will have plenty of opportunities to explore what your final product could look like throughout the course. Where do see yourself 25 years from now? In the year 2040...
The course explores the demographic shift that is occurring around the world as people continue to live longer and have fewer children. This course dives into the challenges and opportunities that are likely to occur over the next 25 years in a multidisciplinary approach that includes 15 academics from over 10 disciplines ranging from demography, to gerontology, architecture and design, health informatics, social work and economics in order to bring a broader perspective to 'rethink ageing' and help lead all of us to ideas and resolutions that are more holistic in their approach.
Another key theme throughout this course is self-reflection. Here is an opportunity to learn innovative approaches to individual and population ageing and be introspective. There will be ample opportunity to share your thoughts on the concepts covered in the discussion board forums, social media sites and in your assessments. 
We hope this integrated course will lead to promoting a sustainable good life in old age - no matter where you are in the world - or where you will be in 2040! Population ageing is occurring in nearly every country around the word. This MOOC takes a multidisciplinary approach to explore the impact of living longer and takes into account the technological advancements, the built environment, economics and ethics to rethink what it means to 'age well' now and in the future." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Although the cloud service topics in this course will be taught in the context of connecting mobile devices to the cloud, the concepts are broader and will give students the ability to create the cloud services to support large-scale web applications, such as social networking applications; cloud services for embedded systems, such as the Internet of Things and Industrial Internet; and wearable computing devices.The course is organized into the sections outlined below (additional lectures may be provided live once the MOOC has begun):Module 1: Android App Security and RisksPart 1: Traditional App AccountsPart 2: Mobile vs. Traditional App AccountsPart 3: App Account Mapping to Linux UsersPart 4: Apps Lie &amp; StealPart 5: How Android Protects AppsPart 6: What Android Doesn't ProtectPart 7: Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Public LocationsPart 8: Risks of Insecure File PermissionsModule 2: Building More Secure Android AppsPart 0: The Challenge of Secure CodingPart 1: Security Vulnerability WalkthroughPart 2: Principles of Secure AbstractionsPart 3: Avoid Coupling Data &amp; Security StatePart 4: Build Abstractions that are Hard to Use InsecurelyPart 5: Bound &amp; Strongly Type Security StatePart 6: Avoid Conditional Logic in Secure PathwaysPart 7: Prevent Secure Pathways from Being Broken at RuntimePart 8: Privilege Escalation ConceptsPart 9: Privilege Escalation ScenarioPart 10: Privilege Escalation Code WalkthroughPart 11: Privilege Escalation FixesPart 12: User Interface AttacksPart 13: Cross-platform User Interface AttacksModule 3: Secure HTTP CommunicationPart 1: Man in the Middle Attacks Public Key InfrastructurePart 2: HTTPSPart 3: Challenges of Storing Secrets on MobilePart 4: WebView Security Issues &amp; Best PracticesModule 4: What was I Saying: Keeping Track of SessionsPart 1: SessionsPart 2: Spring Security OverviewPart 3: Spring Security Configuration in JavaPart 4: Building a Custom UserDetailsServicePart 5: Setting up a custom UserDetailsServicePart 6: The PrincipalPart 7: Spring Security Role AnnotationsPart 8: More Complex Expression-based Pre Post Authorize AnnotationsPart 9: Spring Security Controller Code WalkthroughPart 10: Spring Security Controller Test Code WalkthroughModule 5: Authenticating Mobile Clients with OAuthPart 1: Stateful Sessions with Cookies Why They Aren't Ideal for MobilePart 2: Stateless Sessions with TokensPart 3: OAuth 2.0Part 4: Spring Security OAuth 2.0Part 5: A Spring OAuth 2.0 Secured ServicePart 6: A Retrofit Oauth 2.0 Client for Password Grants A key challenge of mobile platforms is that the apps installed on a device increase the number of potential security vulnerabilities. Mistakes in app development or cloud services can lead to vulnerabilities that cause users data to be stolen, charges to user accounts, and spread of malware to a user’s friends. Ensuring that mobile cloud application developers are aware of potential vulnerabilities and avoid introducing them into their code is an essential part of building a more secure app ecosystem.The course is designed to help students understand how to write more secure mobile cloud applications for Android. Students will be introduced to specific vulnerabilities that have affected well-known apps and be given a wide view of app threats on Android. Developers will also be introduced to the secure coding techniques that can be used to help prevent the introduction of app and cloud service vulnerabilities.The Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) SpecializationThis is the 6th course of the six-course Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization. It has been designed as part of a Coursera Specialization designed to help learners create complex, cloud-based Android Applications, and includes a final “capstone” project for those who earn Verified Certificates across all six courses.Note: We are proud to announce that the MoCCA specialization has already reached hundreds of thousands of learners around the globe. In its last iteration, we worked with Google to provide Nexus tablets, feedback from the Google App team, and the potential to be featured in the Google Play store to top course completers.This time around, we are providing more flexibility for all of you busy learners. We are running the Programming Mobile Applications courses in more digestible one-month-long sections, each with a meaningful mini-project at the end. Additionally, we will be re-offering the courses more frequently. For example, new sessions of my two introductory courses will be launched on a monthly basis, so that you can find a convenient time to join us or pick up where you left off if you didn’t quite finish before.For previous MoCCA students: If you have already earned a Verified Certificate in the previous version of this course, "Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems” offered in May 2014, you do not need to retake this course to continue towards the Specialization certificate and final project in 2015. Please consult the Specializations Help Center or contact the Coursera support team if you are not sure whether you qualify.This MOOC and five others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera platform, structured as follows:The first two courses by Dr. Adam Porter, of the University of Maryland, are Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems Part 1 and Part 2. They focus on the design and programming of user-facing applications. &nbsp;The third and fourth courses by Dr. Douglas Schmidt, of Vanderbilt University, are Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Concurrency and Communication. They focus on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services. &nbsp;The fifth and sixth courses by Dr. Jules White, of Vanderbilt University, are Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems: Spring and Security. &nbsp;They focus on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. The final “capstone” project will require students to develop a complex mobile cloud computing application from the ground up.Some of the programming assignments and the iRemember integrative project for these MOOCs will be coordinated. &nbsp;If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud. This course introduces students to basic issues in mobile cloud security, malware, and secure client/server communication. Students will learn about security risks in Android and cloud services, threat mitigation strategies, secure coding practices, and tools for managing security of devices." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Final Exam Are you curious about quantitative academic finance? Have you considered graduate study in finance? Are you working in an investment bank, money-management firm or hedge fund and you want to understand models better? Would you like to know what buzzwords like beta, risk premium, risk-neutral price, arbitrage, equity premium, and discount factor mean? This class is for you.&nbsp;We will see how one basic idea, price equals expected discounted payoff, unites everything - models that describe stocks, bonds, options, real investments, discrete time, continuous time, asset pricing, portfolio theory, and so forth.&nbsp;In this part I, we’ll quickly learn or review time-series in continuous and discrete time. We'll look at some basic facts. Then we’ll start with the underlying consumption-based model, and we’ll preview some classic issues in finance. That outlines the big ideas of the whole class. Then, we'll take a step back and study contingent claims and the theorems showing the existence of a discount factor (the m in p=E(mx)). We'll explore the mean-variance frontier and expected return vs. beta models and factor structures. We will study the classic linear models — CAPM, APT, ICAPM. We will learn how to use GMM to estimate and evaluate asset pricing models, as well as the classic regression tests. This paves the way for Part 2&nbsp;which focuses on applications and empirical evaluation.&nbsp;The math in real, academic, finance is not actually that hard. Understanding how to use the equations, and see what they really mean about the world... that's hard, and that's what I hope will be uniquely rewarding about this class. This course is part one of a two-part introductory survey of graduate-level academic asset pricing. We will focus on building the intuition and deep understanding of how the theory works, how to use it, and how to connect it to empirical facts. This first part builds the basic theoretical and empirical tools around some classic facts. The second part delves more deeply into applications and empirical evaluation." ,"Coursera"	"en"	
"Wiretaps to Big Data: Privacy and Surveillance in the Age of Interconnection"	"Social Sciences How does cellular technology enable massive surveillance? Do users have rights against surveillance? How does surveillance affect how we use cellular and other technologies? How does it affect our democratic institutions? Do you know that the metadata collected by a cellular network speaks volumes about its users? In this course you will explore all of these questions while investigating related issues in WiFi and Internet surveillance. The issues explored in this course are at the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology and will appeal to anyone interested in the technical, political, and moral questions inherent in the use of information networks. The course will include broad overviews for the novice, while pointing to the detailed resources needed for those engaged in the development of corporate or governmental policies.

"DNA - From Structure to Therapy"	"This course explains one of the key molecules in life: Deoxyribonucleic Acid
(DNA). DNA stores the genetic information in all living cells. The sequence of
its building blocks defines both individual identity and species diversity.
Changes in DNA can lead to cancer and other diseases. DNA-based technology is
now used to detect and treat diseases. In this course, we will take you on a
journey from the DNA molecule to the development of novel therapies. We will
first look at some historical aspects and key experiments such as how DNA was
identified and proven to be the keeper of genetic information. We will then
describe how DNA becomes duplicated (when cells divide) and how the genetic
information stored on DNA is organized into genes. Next, we will explain how
genes become transcribed into a messenger molecule (mRNA) and eventually
translated into proteins that carry out the actual cellular functions. With
this basic knowledge, we will then look at simple DNA-based techniques and how
they are employed not just in basic research but also in everyday life: for
the analysis of food, in crime scene investigations and forensics, for the
diagnosis of genetic diseases, and for therapy development in modern molecular
medicine. When students have completed the course, they will know a lot about
structure, function, and uses of DNA, and they will understand the DNA-related
words that are often used in the news (e.g. "gene", "mutation", "DNA
fingerprint"). The course will be organized into 14 units of approx. 15 min
each. The units will follow a common scheme with a short introductory sequence
that discusses the importance of the topic covered. The main part of the
lecture will have molecular models, power point animations, live drawings, and
short lecture video sequences. At the end of each unit, we will provide a
question catalogue and links to supporting material. Immediate self testing
will be possible through multiple choice questions and interactive tasks. As
homework, students will work on "open questions" in student-centered
discussion groups. Open questions are based on but not restricted to the
material covered in the course, and students will be encouraged to do their
own reading to answer them. The fourteen units comprise the following topics:
01\. How DNA is present in everyday life (DNA History I) 02\. DNA History II
03\. The structure and properties of DNA - DNA fingerprint 04\. Replication -
the copying of DNA 05\. From DNA to Protein I - Transcription of Genes 06\.
From DNA to Protein II - RNA processing 07\. From DNA to Protein III -
translating the genetic code 08\. Methods I - making Genes visible 09\.
Methods II - amplifying Genes 10\. Introduction to Genetic Diseases - Cancer
11\. Consequences of Mutations 12\. How to repair mutations? 13\. Muscular
Dystrophies - when muscles die 14\. Stem Cell Therapies - replacing defective
cells Learning objectives Participants will be able to answer the following
questions after completing the course: 1\. Why and how has DNA become one of
the most powerful tools in research? 2\. What exactly does gene therapy mean?
3\. Why is it so hard to find a cure for cancer? 4\. For which diseases may
DNA-based technology help developing a therapy? 5\. What are potentials and

As a human being, we all consume products and/or services all the time. This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries. Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially a value chain.&nbsp;For the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers, haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it!&nbsp;In this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective, which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather than short-term symptomatic problem solving.&nbsp; Learn about how to create maximum value through effective supply chain management, in particular, from a dynamic learning perspective." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Journalism Skills for Engaged Citizens"	"Information, Tech & Design Module one: What is a journalist?&nbsp;We cover the history and defining characteristics of journalism practice, and how this has changed over time, and is still changing. We think about what we mean by news, and introduce the principles of news writing. Finally, we introduce Newstown - a lively "virtual town" which will form the basis for our news writing exercises, interview skill development and investigations. There is also a non-assessable practice writing exercise.Module two: Attribution, verification and the structure of news writing.&nbsp;We introduce the inverted pyramid style of news writing, and discuss what it means to check, attribute and verify information. The first assessable news writing exercise is delivered this week.Module three: Finding things out.&nbsp;We discuss interview skills, citizens' rights to access public forums and public documents and the ethics of disclosure, privacy and consent.
Module four: More on interviewing.&nbsp;We discuss different types of questions and what they are good for, and watch some very good and very bad interviews with our Newstown characters. Another assessable news writing exercise will be based on these interviews.
Module five: Leaks and sources.&nbsp;We cover how to develop and manage contacts and sources, the potential of new media for crowdsourcing information, and the complexities of "off the record" interactions, and how to deal with leaks of data and documents. We meet a Newstown "deep throat" and consider what we can publish of what he tells us.&nbsp;
Module six: Newstown scenario.&nbsp;We put all the lessons into practice by participating in a Newstown scenario involving allegations of corruption and the release of public documents. Your task is to break the big story, and write it clearly and with impact.
Module seven: Debrief and feedback.&nbsp;In this module we will debrief and give feedback on the exercise in module six, and ask how we would take the story forward.
Module eight: Key concepts highlighted.&nbsp;We talk about key concepts highlighted by our journalism practice, including impartiality and public interest and basic principles of law and ethics. Finally, we review and wrap up the course. This is a course in basic journalism skills, designed for the many people who are now taking advantage of new media to publish news, views and information. For five hundred years, the privilege of being able to publish was enjoyed by very few people – those who had access to a printing press or a radio microphone or a television camera. Now, almost anyone can publish to the world within minutes of being able to do so. But is it journalism?
How does a citizen journalist find things out, so they can report facts and news - moving beyond merely braying opinion? And what are the legal and ethical pitfalls to publishing facts that some people might prefer remain secret?
Over eight weeks, this course teaches the basics of news writing, how to interview people to gain crucial information, how to develop and manage your sources and how to use your legal rights to access public information - and stay on the right side of the law when you publish. We discuss the ethics behind journalism practice, and conduct a mock investigation into local government. This course aims to empower engaged citizens to better participate in the news ecology. This is a course in basic journalism skills designed for citizens who are using new media to publish news, views and information.

education; Coursera and others offering these massive open online courses are a
challenge for Universities.&nbsp; In addition
to firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and are
doing well.&nbsp; What are their strategies
for survival?

By highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and
industries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing
from happening to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the
study of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches to
disruptions that actually work.&nbsp; Our

My goal, rather, is to put you on the right path by providing a solid foundation and framework for understanding web applications, allowing you to dig deeper and learn more on your own. The next bullet points describe how we're going to do this.Understand the major architectural components in web apps, and how they fit together. &nbsp;Modern web apps are complex. &nbsp;A typical application has a database along with numerous scripts on one end of the web stack, a web server in the middle that delivers information over the Internet, and a user's browser on the other end of the web stack. &nbsp;Even getting started in trying to understand these components can be overwhelming. Consider just the programming languages involved in a typical web stack: from the database (SQL), to the web server (scripting language), to the browser (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), we're dealing with five different programming languages, not to mention the protocols they're operating over

















–&nbsp;and you need to know a little about them too! We'll introduce a number of software design patterns throughout the course that are aimed at helping you to manage this complexity.Use Ruby on Rails. &nbsp;We're going to learn about web apps through the Ruby on Rails framework.&nbsp;

















Rails is a framework for creating web
applications that is built on top of the Ruby programming language.&nbsp;I believe this is one of the best frameworks
for learning about web applications, and it's also proving highly successful as
a platform for commercial offerings.&nbsp;
That said, there are many other frameworks available, and the concepts
you will learn using Rails are transferable to these other frameworks.

"The Next Generation of Infrastructure"	"Engineering We increasingly depend on reliable and affordable supply of energy, water, transport, telecommunication and information services to improve livability and facilitate economic development. However, today's infrastructure systems are drastically changing. They are becoming more and more web-based, interconnected and transnational, with increasingly fragmented public and private ownership, while new technologies are on their way. The capital need for investment in new infrastructures and upgrading of ageing infrastructures is tremendous.

During this infrastructure course you will learn to examine these challenges from a new, combined engineering and social sciences perspective. Subsequently we will focus on the challenges that complex adaptive infrastructure systems pose for governance, management and decision-making in a world full of uncertainties. In the last part of the course, we will introduce a selection of topics and tools (modeling & simulation, value sensitive design, standards, ICT-architecture) which will help you to improve the adequacy of infrastructure systems and services, while dealing with the risks and vulnerabilities of infrastructure interdependencies.

In our case studies, we will focus on topical developments and policies, such as sustainable energy transition (including smart grids), urbanization and its impact on infrastructures, the challenges of climate change and water scarcity, and the phenomenon of inverse infrastructure development (self-organization).  

If you are interested or involved in the functioning of today's and tomorrow's infrastructures, this course is an exceptional learning opportunity, whether you are a student or a professional. You will be interacting with peers all over the world and we will present a large number of case studies.

The course is based on the results of an extensive and renowned international research programme titled 'Next Generation Infrastructures' (NGInfra).

"Systematic Program Design - Part 3: Abstraction, Search and Graphs"	"Computer Science This programming course is unique in focusing on learning a design method rather than a programming language.  This practical method builds on years of research into the structure of good programs that will help you channel your creativity to program well in any language.

A primary challenge in programming is deciding exactly what our program should do. The first contribution of the design method is a set of techniques that help you systematically develop your program requirements. You will also learn to produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later. This is important because useful programs always require later improvements. In addition, you will learn how to make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process.

 

Syllabus

This is a full university course broken into three parts:

In Part 1 you will learn the core design method with a focus on simple data. In this part of the course, we introduce the idea of structuring a program based on the data it consumes. This part concludes with the design of simple interactive programs. The final project is an interactive game.

In Part 2, the focus is on more elaborate forms of data that can be used for more complex information. You will learn when and how to structure data using lists and trees. The final project will be a more elaborate interactive game in which more complex data structures are required.

In Part 3 you will learn about search, generative recursion, graphs and how to blend different kinds of structuring patterns together in more complex programs.  This part of the course concludes with a complex puzzle solving program project.

The course uses a small teaching language that includes the core features of nearly all other languages like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Java etc. Less than a week is required to learn nearly the whole language—the entire rest of the course is spent on program design. The focus on design together with the core nature of the language means that everything you learn will be applicable in any other language you use in the future.

Software is increasingly the vehicle that drives our economy and our personal lives. But software’s pervasiveness, and its importance, make it a target: at the root of many security compromises is vulnerable software.In this course we will look at how to build software that is secure.To start, we must know what we are up against. As such, we will examine the most prevalent software design and implementation defects.&nbsp;We will examine vulnerabilities like buffer overruns and use-after-frees that are present in programs written in low-level programming languages like C and C++, and see how these vulnerabilities can be exploited by a clever attacker. We will also look attacks on applications that are part of the worldwide web -- attacks with names like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking. We will also mention side-channel attacks (such as those based on the size of messages or the time taken to process a request), attacks on the human user (like phishing), and failures of design (like the use of insecure defaults). Examples of these attacks will be taken from the headlines.Having examined these defects and their role in security compromises, we will look at how to prevent them entirely, or mitigate their effects, by improving the software's design and implementation. We will see that security must appear at all phases in the development lifecycle, including requirements development, system design, implementation, and testing/validation.Finally, we will look at state-of-the-art tools and techniques for testing and otherwise verifying that software is secure. We will consider how security testing differs from functional testing (it's harder!). We will look at the art of penetration testing, which is the activity of trying to find and exploit weaknesses in a system prior to its deployment. We will also look at an emerging class of program analysis tools that can automatically identify flaws in programs by analyzing their code.At the conclusion of the course, the student will know how to "build security in" rather than consider it as an afterthought, and will have a plethora of skills, applicable at each phase of the development cycle, that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems. This course we will explore the foundations of software security. We will consider important software vulnerabilities and attacks that exploit them -- such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and session hijacking -- and we will consider defenses that prevent or mitigate these attacks, including advanced testing and program analysis techniques. Importantly, we take a "build security in" mentality, considering techniques at each phase of the development cycle that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems." ,"Coursera"	"en"	
"Logic: Language and Information 1"	"Mathematics, Computer Science: Theory, Engineering Week 1. The Syntax of Propositional Logic; Truth Tables; Classifying PropositionsWeek 2. Relationships between Propositions; Tree Proofs; Soundness and CompletenessWeeks 3–5. Applications to different reasoning domains (take at least two):Electronic Engineering — simplifying digital circuitsPhilosophy — vagueness and borderline casesComputer Science — databases, resolution and propositional PrologLinguistics — meaning: implication vs implicature Information is everywhere: in our words and our world, our thoughts and our theories, our devices and our databases. Logic is the study of that information: the features it has, how it’s represented, and how we can manipulate it. Learning logic helps you formulate and answer many different questions about information:Does this hypothesis clash with the evidence we have or is it consistent with the evidence?Is this argument watertight, or do we need to add more to make the conclusion to really follow from the premises?Do these two sentences say the same things in different ways, or do they say something subtly different?Does this information follow from what’s in this database, and what procedure could we use to get the answer quickly?Is there a more cost-effective design for this digital circuit? And how can we specify what the circuit is meant to do so we could check that this design does what we want?These are questions about Logic. When you learn logic you'll learn to recognise patterns of information and the way it can be represented. These skills are used whether we're dealing with theories, databases, digital circuits, meaning in language, or mathematical reasoning, and they will be used in the future in ways we haven't yet imagined. Learning logic is a central part of learning to think well, and this course will help you learn logic and how you can apply it.If you take this subject, you will learn how to use the core tools in logic: the idea of a formal language, which gives us a way to talk about logical structure; and we'll introduce and explain the central logical concepts such as consistency and validity; models; and proofs. But you won’t only learn concepts and tools. We will also explore how these techniques connect with issues in linguistics, computer science, electronic engineering, and philosophy.  This is an introduction to formal logic and how it is applied in computer science, electronic engineering, linguistics and philosophy. You will learn propositional logic—its language, interpretations and proofs, and apply it to solve problems in a wide range of disciplines." ,"Coursera"	"en"

We illustrate&nbsp;by example&nbsp;how key pattern and framework concepts and relationships are applied in Android Services and various local and remote IPC mechanisms from both an application and infrastructure perspective. Many code examples are shown throughout using Java, with a case study project used to reify the key points throughout all the modules in this section.The PDF and PowerPoint versions of all the slides used in the course will be available online as the videos become available on the course website. This MOOC describes by example how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques. A pattern describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. A framework is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related apps or services. &nbsp;Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of patterns that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code.This MOOC will cover fundamental techniques, patterns, and frameworks related to communicating with local and remote services. In particular, this MOOC course will cover Android mechanisms for interacting with local&nbsp;bound and started services via&nbsp;Intents, Messengers, and the&nbsp;Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL).&nbsp; It will also focus on interacting with&nbsp;remote web services using HTTP and data marshalling with JSON. Remote interaction models, ranging from request on demand, polling, push, and sockets will be discussed. Students that complete this MOOC will have a solid understanding of how to build Android applications and local services that can interact with remote services, handle data marshaling, and perform error handling. Hands-on programming projects will require students to develop Android applications that interact with REST-based services.The Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) SpecializationThis is the fourth course of the six-course Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization. It has been designed as part of a Coursera Specialization designed to help learners create complex, cloud-based Android Applications, and includes a final “capstone” project for those who earn Verified Certificates across all six courses.Note: We are proud to announce that the MoCCA specialization has already reached hundreds of thousands of learners around the globe. In its last iteration, we worked with Google to provide Nexus tablets, feedback from the Google App team, and the potential to be featured in the Google Play store to top course completers.This time around, we are providing more flexibility for all of you busy learners. We are running the Programming Mobile Applications courses in more digestible one-month-long sections, each with a meaningful mini-project at the end. Additionally, we will be re-offering the courses more frequently. For example, new sessions of my two introductory courses will be launched on a monthly basis, so that you can find a convenient time to join us or pick up where you left off if you didn’t quite finish before.For previous MoCCA students: If you have already earned a Verified Certificate in the previous version of this course, "Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems” offered in May 2014, you do not need to retake this course to continue towards the Specialization certificate and final project in 2015. Please consult the Specializations Help Center or contact the Coursera support team if you are not sure whether you qualify.This MOOC and five others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera platform, structured as follows:The first two courses by Dr. Adam Porter, of the University of Maryland, are Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems Part 1 and Part 2. They focus on the design and programming of user-facing applications. &nbsp;The third and fourth courses by Dr. Douglas Schmidt, of Vanderbilt University, are Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Concurrency and Communication. They focus on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services. &nbsp;The fifth and sixth courses by Dr. Jules White, of Vanderbilt University, are Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems: Spring and Security. &nbsp;They focus on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. The final “capstone” project will require students to develop a complex mobile cloud computing application from the ground up.Some of the programming assignments for these MOOCs will be coordinated. &nbsp;If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.

Congestion control and traffic engineering&nbsp;Inter-data center networks In the cloud networking course, we will see what the network needs to do to enable cloud computing. We will explore current practice by talking to leading industry experts, as well as looking into interesting new research that might shape the cloud network’s future.

This course will allow us to explore in-depth the challenges for cloud networking—how do we build a network infrastructure that provides the agility to deploy virtual networks on a shared infrastructure, that enables both efficient transfer of big data and low latency communication, and that enables applications to be federated across countries and continents? Examining how these objectives are met will set the stage for the rest of the course. 

This course places an emphasis on both operations and design rationale—i.e., how things work and why they were designed this way. We're excited to start the course with you and take a look inside what has become the critical communications infrastructure for many applications today. The network is what makes the cloud. The cloud’s key capabilities—the ability to share infrastructure, the ability to move and scale applications across servers, massive parallelism, virtualization, and worldwide connectivity—are all rooted in the network.

Thanks to spatial computing, a hiker in Yellowstone and a taxi driver in Manhattan can know precisely where
    they are, discover nearby points of interest and learn how to reach their destinations. Spatial computing technology is what powers the Foursquare check-in, the maps app on your smartphone, the devices used by scientists to track endangered species,
    the routing directions that help you get from point A to point B, the precision agriculture technology that is revolutionizing farming, and the augmented reality devices like Google Glass that may soon mediate our interaction with the real world.
This course introduces the fundamental ideas underlying spatial computing services, systems, and sciences. Topics covered will include the nature of geospatial information, proper statistical frameworks for working with geospatial data, key algorithms
    and data structures, spatial data mining, and cartography/geovisualization. We will also address applied topics such as where to find spatial data, how to use powerful open source software to analyze and map spatial data, and frameworks for building
    location-based services.
    


    Three Ways to Enjoy this Course:
    

This course is designed to support three different types of students and educational goals:
    

Curiosity Track: Most of us interact with spatial technologies every day. This track is for students who wish to learn about one or two spatial computing topics, but not commit to an entire course. Curiosity track students are not interested in
    a certificate of accomplishment.
    

Concepts Track: This track is for students who want to learn about spatial computing concepts in order to make informed choices, but who are not programmers and do not have extensive experience with statistical methods. For example, concepts track
    students will learn about Tobler’s First Law of geography and map projections, but will not delve into the quantifications of either. Students who complete the concepts track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Statement of Accomplishment.
    

Technical Track: This track builds on the concepts track, but adds math and programming. For example, we will cover spatial statistical indicators like Moran’s I and Ripley’s K when discussing Tobler’s First Law and will have students calculate
    the distance between two points using two different coordinate systems and open-source APIs. Students who complete the technical track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Distinguished Statement of Accomplishment.

"Design and Development of Educational Technology"	"Computer Science To be effective, educational technologies must be designed based on what we know about how people learn. Through interviews with multiple experts in the field, this course examines educational technologies, outlines the theories that influenced their development, and examines their use. The course leads up to a final project – a kickstarter style pitch for a new educational technology - which is worked on iteratively across the weeks.  It involves active weekly participation.

In week 1, we’ll talk about the history of educational technologies and how they change the way we learn. We’ll also discuss two important educational theories that focus on student-centered learning.

In week 2, we’ll explore what it means to learn something and examine several different approaches to deepen learning. We’ll begin by introducing a specific framework for thinking about learning. We’ll then take a close look at how educational software developers are more deeply engaging learners and even providing feedback to students as they learn.

Week 3 will focus on forms of Active Learning, where students choose and pursue activities based on their own interests. We’ll also talk with experts about designing to help build important non-cognitive skills, like persistence and developing mastery.

Week 4 will move from individual learning to collaborative learning in a range of forms, from apprenticeships to communities of practice. We’ll speak with experts about the many ways learning in groups can manifest itself. No matter what the medium, collaborative learning has a lot to teach us.

Week 5 focuses on assessment.  All the clever educational technology design in the world isn’t very useful if we don’t know whether students’ learning is being enhanced by it or what changes need to be made to increase its effectiveness. We’ll talk with teachers, students, and assessment experts who will provide an overview of the different types of assessment and how technology is changing the field of assessment.

Finally, in week 6, we’ll talk about design-based research, a methodology for research and design of educational innovations in which you create projects that embody the educational change you wish to study.

Week 0 of this course is a 'ramp-up' week for participants to introduce themselves to one another and become familiar with the forums and other course platform features." ,""	"English"	
"Certified C Coder: Lite Edition"	"C programming is the root or foundation for any person who wants to master computer programming. Learning C in a comprehensive manner is very essential for every software interested soul but things can only be interesting when words are not jargon and every piece of code is explained in detailed manner and that’s what this course is all about. Meet the most comprehensive online C programming course and C tutorials video series. This series will help you to understand basics of programming by introducing data types, constants, and variables. Further we will learn in C coding about various operations that can be performed like arithmetic operations, relational operations, logical operations and bitwise operations. What will you learn in this course? After completing these basic operations we will master intermediate topics like while loops, do while loops and for loops along with lots of conditional operations. Further in the advance section of this online C tutorial, we will explore about functions, arrays, union and structures in C programming language. If you have never coded before in life, then C is a great point to start with. Basics of C programming language will help you to jump in lots of language like c plus plus, python, ruby or php. Mastering other languages becomes easy, once you have mastered C programming language. C is one of the most important of all programming languages. It is used to program desktop applications, compilers, tools and utilities and even hardware devices. C is a general-purpose programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs. C is often used for "system programming", including implementing operating systems and embedded system applications, due to a combination of desirable characteristics such as code portability and efficiency, ability to access specific hardware addresses and low run-time demand on system resources. C can also be used for website programming using CGI as a "gateway" for information between the Web application, the server, and the browser. Some reasons for choosing C over interpreted languages are its speed, stability, and near-universal availability." ,"coursetalk"	"en"

"Probability"	"Mathematics, Engineering, Statistics and Data Analysis The course is divided into five topical segments which taken together constitute a self-contained introduction to mathematical probability.&nbsp; Read on for a bird's-eye view of these topics.Topic I: Towards an axiomatic theory of chanceWe begin with the stirrings of a mathematical theory in the 17th century in the resolution of a historical wager of the Chevalier de Méré and follow the developments in understanding leading to the modern axiomatic foundations of probability established in the 20th century.Topic II: From side information to conditional probabilitiesIn this segment we shall encounter unanticipated challenges to intuition when presented with side information about a probability experiment and discover the subtle importance of additivity in a tongue-in-cheek exhortation on the survival of our species.Topic III: Independence—the warp and the woof in the fabric of chanceThe distinctive and rich intuitive content of the theory of probability and its link to observations in physical experiments is provided by the notion of statistical independence.&nbsp; We follow the progress from multiplication tables to a formal notion of independence, with enticing applications in a casino game, genetics, and sports psychology to whet the appetite.Topic IV: From polls to bombs and queues—enter the binomial and the PoissonWe next turn to ruminations on the implausible efficacy of small polls in tracking sentiments of large populations and discover how the hugely important binomial distribution emerges from these considerations.&nbsp; We then retrace the historical discovery of a curious approximation to the binomial and stumble upon the fascinating Poisson distribution. &nbsp;We promptly explore applications ranging from the merely weighty to the diverting and macabre, the distribution of bomb hits in London in World War II being particularly memorable.Topic V: The fabulous limit laws—the bell curve pirouettes into the picture














The law of large numbers is a cornerstone of probability responsible for much of its intuitive content and it is fitting that our gradual development concludes with it.&nbsp; Among its rich applications, we discover why polls work and the implications to medical testing.&nbsp; The remarkable bell curve now takes centre stage completing the triad of fundamental distributions and we discover why polls really work. The renowned mathematical physicist Pierre-Simon, Marquis de Laplace wrote in his opus on probability in 1812 that “the most important questions of life are, for the most part, really only problems in probability”.&nbsp; His words ring particularly true today in this the century of “big data”.

This introductory course takes us through the development of a modern, axiomatic theory of probability.&nbsp; But, unusually for a technical subject, the material is presented in its lush and glorious historical context, the mathematical theory buttressed and made vivid by rich and beautiful applications drawn from the world around us.&nbsp; The student will see surprises in election-day counting of ballots, a historical wager the sun will rise tomorrow, the folly of gambling, the sad news about lethal genes, the curiously persistent illusion of the hot hand in sports, the unreasonable efficacy of polls and its implications to medical testing, and a host of other beguiling settings.&nbsp; A curious individual taking this as a stand-alone course will emerge with a nuanced understanding of the chance processes that surround us and an appreciation of the colourful history and traditions of the subject.&nbsp; And for the student who wishes to study the subject further, this course provides a sound mathematical foundation for courses at the advanced undergraduate or graduate levels.&nbsp; How should we interpret chance around us?  Watch beautiful mathematical ideas emerge in a glorious historical tapestry as we discover key concepts in probability, perhaps as they might first have been unearthed, and illustrate their sway with vibrant applications taken from history and the world around." ,"Coursera"	"en"

But where did SARS come from? By constructing an evolutionary tree of the unknown virus as well as viruses taken from other species, we can not only understand which animal gave us SARS, but also reconstruct its path around the globe. This is just one of many problems in modern biology related to constructing evolutionary trees.In 2007, a team of biologists announced that some proteins had miraculously survived within a 68 million year old dinosaur fossil. Moreover, they concluded that the amino acid sequences of these dinosaur proteins were nearly identical to sequences in modern-day chickens. Based on this discovery, famed paleontologist Jack Horner (who inspired the character of Dr. Grant from Jurassic Park) hopes to resurrect dinosaurs by genetically re-engineering a chicken. &nbsp;But did these peptides really come from T. rex? To answer this question, we will need to explore the field of computational proteomics.In the end of the course, a Bioinformatics Application Challenge&nbsp;will let you apply popular bioinformatics software tools to construct an evolutionary tree of different Ebola viruses and hypothesize where the 2014 Ebola outbreak came from. In this course, we will see how evolutionary trees resolve quandaries from finding the origin of a deadly virus to locating the birthplace of modern humans. We will then use methods from computational proteomics to test whether we can reconstruct Tyrannosaurus rex proteins and prove that birds evolved from dinosaurs." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Point mutations, in which a single nucleotide (A, C, G, T) is altered, inserted, or deleted, are comparable to erosion slowly changing the shape of a boulder. Much of human differentiation is attributable to the accumulation of point mutations.The other type of mutation is extremely rare and can cause dramatic effects on the scale of species evolution. &nbsp;In genome rearrangements, huge blocks of DNA are heaved around, often from one chromosome to another. These mutations are comparable to earthquakes, which hoist up mountains and wrench apart continents.When we compare two relatively short pieces of DNA that have not been affected by genome rearrangements (say, two genes taken from individuals from the same species), our goal is to identify a "path of least resistance" connecting these two genes via point mutations. &nbsp;We can find such a path using a powerful algorithmic paradigm called dynamic programming.On the other hand, when we zoom out to the compare entire genomes taken from different species that diverged millions of years ago (such as humans and mice), the effects of genome rearrangements become more pronounced. To determine how far diverged these genomes are, we will need completely different combinatorial algorithms&nbsp;that will help us answer&nbsp;questions about the patterns of genome rearrangements. For example, in order to move around large blocks of DNA, a genome rearrangement must "break" the genome in at least two places. We know that there are fault lines on the earth's surface where earthquakes are more likely; are there analogous "fragile regions" in the human genome where breakage has been more likely to occur during a genome rearrangement? After sequencing genomes, we would like to compare them. We will see that dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic tool when we compare two genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or two proteins. When we "zoom out" to compare entire genomes, we will employ combinatorial algorithms." ,"Coursera"	"en"	
"Paradigms of Computer Programming – Abstraction and Concurrency"	"Computer Science Louv1.2x and its predecessor Louv1.1x together give an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.

The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.

Louv1.1x (Fundamentals) covers functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You’ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.

Louv1.2x (Abstraction and Concurrency) covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You’ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You’ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.

To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, watch the introductory video.  How to specify problems, break them down into their basic steps, and design algorithms and abstractions to solve them

  Week 8. Clustering with k-means
  (K-Means
  iterations and K-Means features    
  K-Means
  criterion. Anomalous clusters and intelligent K-Means.) This is an
unconventional course in modern Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Data
Mining. Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysis
should help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as represented
by the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to this
view, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing and
augmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations.
The term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals and
means and more complex summaries: the principal
components of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities.
Similarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations between
input and target features including Bayes classifiers.

The view of the data as a subject of
computational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently.
Typically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then the
investigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards a
solution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially with
the advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this data
set - what sense can be made out of it? – Is there any structure in the data
set? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to a
traveler’s view of the world rather than that of a scientist. The scientist
sits at his desk, gets reproducible signals from the universe and tries to accommodate
them into a great model of the universe. The traveler deals with what come on
their way – here is the data analysis niche. 
A textbook by the instructor along these lines has been published by
Springer-London in 2011: “Core
concepts in data analysis is clean and devoid
of any fuzziness. The author presents his theses with a refreshing clarity
seldom seen in a text of this sophistication. … To single out just one of the
text’s many successes: I doubt readers will ever encounter again such a detailed
and excellent treatment of correlation concepts. (Computing Reviews of
ACM, June 2011).” Learn both theory and application for basic methods that have been invented either for developing new concepts – principal components or clusters, or for finding interesting correlations – regression and classification.   This is preceded by a thorough analysis of 1D and 2D data." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Discusses the management of conversational state between actors and patterns for flow control, routing of messages to pools of actors for resilience or load balancing, acknowledgement of reception to achieve reliable delivery. This is a follow-on for the Coursera class “Principles of Functional Programming in Scala”, which so far had more than 100’000 inscriptions over two iterations of the course, with some of the highest completion rates of any massive open online course worldwide.The aim of the second course is to teach the principles of reactive programming. Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state&nbsp;by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors.In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of message-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, which are also programming projects. Learn how to write composable software that stays responsive at all times by being elastic under load and resilient in the presence of failures.

networking in the past decade. The cloud is now “descending” to the network
edge and often diffused among the client devices in both mobile and wireline
networks. The cloud is becoming the “fog.” Empowered by the latest chips,
radios, and sensors, each client device today is powerful in computation, in
storage, in sensing and in communication. Yet client devices are still limited
in battery power, global view of the network, and mobility support. Most
interestingly, the collection of many clients in a crowd presents a highly
distributed, under-organized, and possibly dense network. 

Fog Networking is an architecture that will also support the Internet of Things, IoT, such as the “connected wearables.” Bold, new user interfaces are getting close to affordable price points for the mass, begging questions on the “architectural choices for the glasses and watches,” from naming to billing, and from session management to resource optimization.

"Introduction to Acoustics (Part 2)"	"Engineering Week 1. Radiation – Breathing &amp; Trembling Sphere
Problem

-&nbsp;What happens
if we have a certain discontinuity that is a function of three spatial
variables (e.g. x,y,z for Cartesian coordinate)?-&nbsp;What are the
radiation characteristics of a breathing sphere, which is assumed to vibrate
omni-directionally with equal magnitude?

-&nbsp;What is the
difference between a breathing sphere and a trembling sphere, which vibrates in
a certain direction with a uniform velocity?

Week 2. Radiation – Baffled Piston &amp; Finite Vibrating
Plate Problem

-&nbsp;How can we
generate sound? By the fluctuation of fluid particles or the vibration of
structures? How are they related?

-&nbsp;How can we
understand the radiation of a finite vibrating plate? Can we assume this plate
as numerous vibrating pistons?

&nbsp;Week 3. Scattering
&amp; Diffraction / Kirchhoff-Helmholtz Equation

-&nbsp;How can we
express the wave propagation when it is reflected due to the presence of discontinuities
in space?

-&nbsp;How can we
explain the circumstances under which we can hear sound but cannot see the
sound source?

-&nbsp;What is the relation
between the wavelength and the diffraction?
Week 4. Wave Propagation in Space / Reverberation Period and its Design
Application

-&nbsp;If there are
different types of impedance distribution in space, how can we explain the
propagation characteristics?

-&nbsp;How can we
acoustically define ‘large’ or ‘small’ space’? Is it related to the frequency?

-&nbsp;Is there any
measure that can represent the characteristics of the space?Week 5. Wave
Propagation in Space / Duct Acoustics

-&nbsp;How can we
express the sound field that is neither fully diffuse field nor only a direct
field? 

-&nbsp;When the size
of the space is small relative to wavelength, what happens to the propagation
of sound?

-&nbsp;When the
length of one direction is significantly greater than the cross-sectional
direction of the space, how does the wave propagate with respect to its
wavelength? This course introduces acoustics by using the concept of impedance. In the previous part, the course starts with vibrations and waves, demonstrating how vibration can be envisaged as a kind of wave, mathematically and physically. They are realized by one-dimensional examples, which provide mathematically simplest but clear enough physical insights. Then the part 1 ends with explaining waves on a flat surface of discontinuity, demonstrating how propagation characteristics of waves change in space where there is a distributed impedance mismatch.&nbsp;Following the part 1, part 2 starts with radiation, scattering, and diffraction, which can be explained in a unified way by seeing the changes of waves due to spatially distributed impedance. Lastly, the course covers sound in closed space, which is considered to be a space that is surrounded by spatially distributed impedance, and introduces two spaces: acoustically large and small space.&nbsp;This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in acoustics, audio engineering, and noise control engineering. Practicing engineers and researchers in audio engineering and noise control, or students in engineering and physics disciplines, who want to gain an understanding sound and vibration concepts, are also welcome. For the continuity of the lecture, taking part 1 of the course is recommended (but not required).&nbsp; Learn about acoustics by using the concept of impedance.

Aerodynamics of car-cyclist combinationsInterview&nbsp; with professional cycling coaches from teams Belkin and RaboLiv Can
the present outstanding records in cycling team time trials be
further improved? Can the present world and Olympic records in
athletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? This
course provides the answer to these questions. It shows that
aerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complex
and that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are caused
by the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly, the same
counter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in both
sports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course will
help you to understand and improve the performance of top athletes
and of modern building design. In
2013, team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for a
Tour de France team time trial, with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25
km, beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At the
subsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships, the latter team beat
the former by only 0.88 s. Clearly, even minor aerodynamic
improvements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And,
surprisingly, up to now, the optimum aerodynamic setting for a team
time trial has not yet been explored.
Records
in athletics races such as the 100 m sprint, the 110 m hurdles and
the long jump are only validated by the IAAF (International
Association of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed
2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tail
winds close to 2 m/s. Clearly, local aerodynamic effects can be
decisive in establishing new records. Also here, the optimum
aerodynamic setting has not yet been explored.

New
and prestigious building projects are realized in different parts of
the world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energy
systems in the building design. Also here, aerodynamic misconceptions
can lead to suboptimal performance. 


The
course starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects of
fluid flow: statics, kinematics, dynamics, flow regimes and boundary
layers, including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports and
building aerodynamics take place. Next, the main aspects of the
aerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing and
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined. Tips and
tricks for wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations are given. This
knowledge provides the basis for the course parts on building
aerodynamics, 100 m sprint aerodynamics and cycling aerodynamics,
where some surprising and sometimes spectacular results will be
shown. Have we reached the boundaries of what can be achieved in sports and building design? The answer is definitely “NO”. This course explains basic aspects of bluff body aerodynamics, wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with application to sports and building aerodynamics. It is intended for anyone with a strong interest in these topics. Key fields addressed are urban physics, wind engineering and sports engineering." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Discrete Time Signals and Systems, Part 2: Frequency Domain"	"Engineering Technological innovations have revolutionized the way we view and interact with the world around us. Editing a photo, re-mixing a song, automatically measuring and adjusting chemical concentrations in a tank: each of these tasks requires real-world data to be captured by a computer and then manipulated digitally to extract the salient information. Ever wonder how signals from the physical world are sampled, stored, and processed without losing the information required to make predictions and extract meaning from the data?

Students will find out in this rigorous mathematical introduction to the engineering field of signal processing: the study of signals and systems that extract information from the world around us. This course will teach students to analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both the time and frequency domains. Students will learn convolution, discrete Fourier transforms, the z-transform, and digital filtering. Students will apply these concepts in interactive MATLAB programming exercises (all done in browser, no download required).

Part 1 of this course analyzes signals and systems in the time domain. Part 2 covers frequency domain analysis.

Prerequisites include strong problem solving skills, the ability to understand mathematical representations of physical systems, and advanced mathematical background (one-dimensional integration, matrices, vectors, basic linear algebra, imaginary numbers, and sum and series notation). Part 1 is a prerequisite for Part 2. This course is an excerpt from an advanced undergraduate class at Rice University taught to all electrical and computer engineering majors.

"Everything is the Same: Modeling Engineered Systems"	"Engineering Topics:1. What does it mean to model a physical system?2. Newton's laws3. Mechanical components connected together4. Chemical diffusion5. Laws governing electrical behavior6. Circuits and electrical components connected together7. Analogies between physical systems8. Diffusion is everywhere Students
 in this class will learn modeling and analysis techniques applicable to
 electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems.  This “systems” view, 
that focuses on what is common to these different physical systems, has 
been responsible for much of the progress in the last several decades in
 aeronautics, robotics, and other engineering disciplines where there 
are many different technologies working together.  Starting
 with algebraic descriptions of individual components (such as 
resistors), the class develops tools for modeling engineered systems.  Differential 
equations are key ingredients, so we will spend significant time 
learning how to derive differential equations from component descriptions. 
 One of the key ideas in this class is that electrical, mechanical, and 
chemical systems may seem very different from each other but often have 
very similar behavior, allowing us to draw powerful analogies between 
them.  Case studies from several areas of engineering will be used to 
illustrate the modeling techniques, including examples from robotics, 
power networks, exoskeletons, biomechanics, system identification, and active sensing.  Students will be encouraged to do hands-on 
experiments that demonstrate the techniques.   This introduction to engineering course will help you learn modeling and analysis techniques for electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems and discover how engineered systems that seem very different are actually very similar." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Systematic Program Design - Part 2: Arbitrary Sized Data"	"Computer Science Course Syllabus
        Syllabus

This is a full university course broken into three parts:

In Part 1 you will learn the core design method with a focus on simple data. In this part of the course, we introduce the idea of structuring a program based on the data it consumes. This part concludes with the design of simple interactive programs. The final project is an interactive game.

In Part 2, the focus is on more elaborate forms of data that can be used for more complex information. You will learn when and how to structure data using lists and trees. The final project will be a more elaborate interactive game in which more complex data structures are required.

In Part 3 you will learn about search, generative recursion, graphs and how to blend different kinds of structuring patterns together in more complex programs.  This part of the course concludes with a complex puzzle solving program project.

The course uses a small teaching language that includes the core features of nearly all other languages like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Java etc. Less than a week is required to learn nearly the whole language—the entire rest of the course is spent on program design. The focus on design together with the core nature of the language means that everything you learn will be applicable in any other language you use in the future.

Systematic Program Design - Part 1: The Core Method

Systematic Program Design - Part 3: Abstraction, Search and Graphs This programming course is unique in focusing on learning a design method rather than a programming language.  This practical method builds on years of research into the structure of good programs that will help you channel your creativity to program well in any language.

A primary challenge in programming is deciding exactly what our program should do. The first contribution of the design method is a set of techniques that help you systematically develop your program requirements. You will also learn to produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later. This is important because useful programs always require later improvements. In addition, you will learn how to make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process.

"Developing International Software"	"Computer Science Developing software for one market, and shipping it internationally with a few tweaks is simply impossible. Learn how to  create “world-ready” software from expert programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies.

Developing international software involves far more than translating the User Interface. You must sharpen your business acumen to determine whether shipping software to a specific market is even worth the effort. You must deepen your knowledge of cultural differences so you don’t include a feature, visual, or turn of phrase that offends potential customers. You must understand that differences in language affect input methods, sorting orders, text layout, fonts, and dialog box sizes, and that countries use different currency symbols, number formats, keyboard layouts, and measurement systems--and you should internalize all of this before you write a single line of code.

In this era of rapid development and intense competition, it is tempting to focus on what’s “most important” first, leaving the rest for later; but waiting until the end of the software development cycle to start thinking about markets outside of your own is a strategy that can result in delays or embarrassing failures, costing you time and money, alienating potential customers, and damaging your brand.

In this course, programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies will teach you the secrets to creating a “world-ready” software design and codebase that will make shipping software to markets around the world a smoother, less expensive, and less time-consuming process. The course has three discrete sections: business considerations, design, and development.

And how can we specify what the circuit is meant to do so we could check that this design does what we want?These are questions about Logic. When you learn logic you'll learn to recognise patterns of information and the way it can be represented. These skills are used whether we're dealing with theories, databases, digital circuits, meaning in language, or mathematical reasoning, and they will be used in the future in ways we haven't yet imagined. Learning logic is a central part of learning to think well, and this course will help you learn logic and how you can apply it.This subject follows from Logic: Language and Information 1, to cover core techniques in first order predicate logic: the idea of formal languages with quantifiers, which gives us a way to talk about more logical structure than in propositional logic; and we will cover the central logical concepts such as consistency and validity; models; and proofs in predicate logic. But you won’t only learn these concepts and tools. We will also explore how these techniques connect with issues in linguistics, computer science, electronic engineering, mathematics, and philosophy. This is an introduction to predicate logic and how it is applied in computer science, electronic engineering, linguistics, mathematics and philosophy. Building on your knowledge of propositional logic, you will learn predicate logic—its language, interpretations and proofs, and apply it to solve problems in a wide range of disciplines." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Note

You will need to purchase either the EK-TM4C123GXL board from Texas Instruments and a set of electronic components. The cost for these parts is about $40 USD plus shipping. We will provide instructions at: http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html .

You will need a PC running Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10. You will need to be able to install the Keil uVision integrated development environment, which will require administrative privileges to the PC. We will provide instructions at: http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html . Learn how electronic gadgets are designed, developed, and built as embedded systems that shape the world.

This is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will possess the knowledge to build your own arcade-style game from the ground up.

This is the third time we have offered this course. Since the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive we do not plan major changes from the previous offering of the course. There are 14 labs, but students can pick and choose seven of them to achieve certification. The three labs that students found most rewarding were the finite state machine traffic light controller, generating sound using a digital to analog convertor, and creating a smart object using Wifi communication. This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems.

To complete this course, you will be required to purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state-of-the-art ARM Cortex-M4 processor.

We will provide instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software at: http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html.

FAQ

How will the Spring 2016 course be the same as the course run Spring 2015? 

This course will be lab-based using the same Texas Instruments Tiva series TM4C123 LaunchPad and the set of extra components. We will continue to use the Keil development system, and students will first develop/test in simulation followed by testing on the real board. 12 of the 14 labs will be essentially the same and two labs will be upgraded. Same as last year, students will need to complete at least seven of the labs on the real board to achieve certification.

How will the Spring 2016 course be different from the course run Spring 2015? 

This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems.

Is this class related to a campus course of The University of Texas at Austin? 

Yes, this course corresponds to the Electrical and Computer Engineering course EE319K Introduction to Embedded Systems, which is a required course offered in the freshman year to all ECE students and some BME students.

Is there a textbook associated with this class? 

The class is based on the textbook Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers ISBN: 978-1477508992. However, the purchase of the textbook is not required.

Do I need a Windows PC? 

Yes, any system running Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 will be ok. Furthermore, with a third party virtualization software like Parallels or VMware Fusion, one can install the Windows operating system on a Mac.

How much does it cost to take this class? 

It does not cost anything to take the class. However, since this a lab-based class, there is a lab kit you will purchase. You will also have the option of obtaining an ID Verified certificate for a $50 fee.

How much does the kit cost? 

In the US one can purchase the microcontroller board and parts for about $40 USD plus shipping. There is also an optional graphics display for an additional $10 USD plus shipping. The optional graphics display will make the last lab a lot more fun. The CC3100 Boosterpack costs $20 USD plus shipping and will be required if you wish to complete the Wifi lab.

Can I take this course without buying the kit? 

Yes, there are three approaches to taking this class.

You could listen to the videos, read the assignments, and play with the interactive learning tools.
	The second option involves installing the Keil uVision integrated development environment on a Windows PC, and performing the lab assignments in simulation mode.
	The third option, which fully captures the essence of embedded systems, can be done by performing the lab assignments on a real system that you will purchase.
Can I use another microcontroller? 

If you are following approach one, where you are listening to the videos, reading the assignments and playing with the interactive tools, then you can use any microcontroller. However, if you wish to obtain certification, you will need to use the Tiva series TM4C123 so you can interact with the automatic graders.

What does it mean for the display to be optional? 

In the last lab you will build an arcade-style game. We expect most students will connect the microcontroller board to the PC. In this manner the game output can be displayed on a window of the PC. However, for about $10 USD plus shipping, you can order a small Nokia 5110 LCD display so your game can be operated in a stand-alone fashion.

Will this course really take 10 hours per week? 

The first option of just listening, reading and playing with interactive animations will take two or three hours per week. The second option of performing the labs in simulation will take five or six hours per week. The third option of building and testing systems on the real microcontroller will require 10 hours per week.

Can I take this course if I have never programmed before? 

Anyone is allowed register, but we believe to get the maximum benefit you should have prior programming experience at an introductory level. However, this could be your second class involving programming.

Can I contact the Instructors or Teaching Assistants? 

Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. Instructors will monitor these forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases responses from other students will be adequate and faster.

I really want to take this course, what is next? 

You should purchase the microcontroller and extra electronics before the start of class. This class is available worldwide and we will provide region-specific methods to obtain the kit at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html.

advances in image and video processing Digital images and videos are everywhere these days – in thousands of
scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and
artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the
electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and
beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an
incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software
developers, and practicing scientists.  
Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia
technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of
image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer
during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car),
and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos
online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!),
for economical storage and efficient transmission. 

This course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools – from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.  In all cases, example images and videos pertaining to specific application domains will be utilized. In this class you will learn the basic principles and tools used to process images and videos, and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial and scientific interests." ,"Coursera"	"en"	
"TC309: mHealth - Mobile Phones for Public Health"	"Mobile technologies and networks are increasingly expanding in their
sophistication and capacity, and new applications are enhancing the ways in
which individuals interact and engage in transactions- resulting in widespread
systems disruption.  In global health, mobile technologies are beginning to
show improvements in access to health services and information, quality of
care, and efficiency, yielding time and cost savings in addressing maternal
and child health, HIV and AIDS, malaria, TB, universal access to health care,
and other health issues.  Increasingly, Ministries of Health, industry, NGOs,
and various bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors and organizations are looking
toward mobile phones as a critical element within their strategies for
improving health outcomes and well-being.  Many have expressed great interest
in becoming better informed consumers and implementers of mHealth.

To support this demand, TechChange and the mHealth Alliance are pleased to
announce a four-week online certificate course on mHealth: Mobile Phones for
Public Health. The two organizations have partnered to provide the course
based on the pervasive interest in the topic of mobile health (mHealth) as
well as the need to develop more skills and exchange of best practices among
practitioners in the sector.

The Mobile Phones for Public Health course will examine how mobile
technologies are revolutionizing approaches to patient care and management,
point-of-care support for health workers, health education, diagnostics, and
supply chain management and logistics. Through case studies, guest expert
interviews, multimedia tutorials, interactive exercises, and live
demonstrations of tools, participants will explore delivery mechanisms, such
as interactive voice recognition (IVR),  SMS (text message) communication
programs, smartphone applications, and health information systems for data
collection and management. The course aims to present a broad range of
perspectives on mHealth, including those from to governments, private sector,
academia, NGOs, and bilateral and multi-lateral organizations and donors from
Africa, Asia, and Latin America." ,"coursetalk"	"en"	
"Understanding the Cloud"	"What is the cloud? If you have trouble answering this question, you're not
alone. In this course, we'll explore how the cloud works, what drives its
incredible growth, and how you can use cloud services. And don't worry if
you're not tech-savvy! We'll relate the cloud to things you encounter every
day, using practical, non-technical language. We'll start by looking at the
building blocks of the cloud, where it started, and how it transitioned from
an experiment into an unstoppable force. You'll also gain a clear
understanding of IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS, and see why each may be attractive to
some businesses, but not others. And you'll learn about the different kinds of
clouds (public, private, and hybrid). We'll also take an inside look at the
engine rooms of the cloud: data centers. You'll examine the concept of big
data?the overwhelmingly huge amounts of data that make analysis so
challenging—and how the cloud infrastructure enables data to zip across the
globe at lightning speed. Social networking has also played an incredibly
important role in the growth of the cloud. We'll examine how Facebook and
Twitter contribute to the cloud, and how apps go from idea to app store.
You'll gain an understanding of how mobile devices and major mobile
ecosystems?like Apple, Android, and Windows?continue to shape the cloud, and
how start-ups can use social media to shake things up like never before. So
come see how the how the cloud can work for you! Whatever your technical
background, by the end of this course, you'll be thoroughly cloud-savvy." ,"coursetalk"	"en"	
"Reproducible Research"	"Information, Tech & Design, Statistics and Data Analysis In this course you will learn to write a document using R markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program, compile R markdown documents using knitr and related tools, and organize a data analysis so that it is reproducible and accessible to others. This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results. Learn the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. This is the fifth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization." ,"Coursera"	"en"	
"iOS Game Development with Sprite Kit"	"Games have always been a big deal on iOS, but up to now you needed to use an
external framework or library—like Cocos2D—or write your own painstaking game

game engine, which is officially built into the SDK. Sprite Kit is for
creating 2D games, including features for animation, particle systems, and a
full physics engine.  
  
Here, Simon Allardice shows how to create your own 2D game: building levels
(aka scenes) with artwork, animation, and audio. He first explores the core
concepts and vocabulary of Sprite Kit and then, by recreating examples of
classic 2D games, shows how to create independent game objects with their own

"High Performance Scientific Computing"	"Information, Tech & Design, Statistics and Data Analysis The use of a variety of languages and techniques will be integrated throughout
    the course as much as possible, rather than taught linearly. The topics
    below will be covered at an introductory level, with the goal of learning
    enough to feel comfortable starting to use them in your everyday work.
    Once you've reached that level, abundant resources are available on the
    web to learn the more advanced features that are most relevant for you.

    Working at the command line in Unix-like shells (e.g. Linux or a Mac OSX
        terminal).
    Version control systems, particularly git, and the use of Github and Bitbucket
        repositories.
    Work habits for documentation of your code and reproducibility of your
        results.
    Interactive Python using IPython, and the IPython Notebook.
    Python scripting and its uses in scientific computing.
    Subtleties of computer arithmetic that can affect program correctness.
    How numbers are stored: binary vs. ASCII representations, efficient I/O.
    Fortran 90, a compiled language that is widely used in scientific computing.
    Makefiles for building software and checking dependencies.
    The high cost of data communication.&nbsp; Registers, cache, main memory,
        and how this memory hierarchy affects code performance.&nbsp;
    OpenMP on top of Fortran for parallel programming of shared memory computers,
        such as a multicore laptop.
    &nbsp;MPI on top of Fortran for distributed memory parallel programming,
        such as on a cluster.
    Parallel computing in IPython.
    Debuggers, unit tests, regression tests, verification and validation of
        computer codes.
    Graphics and visualization of computational results using Python. Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of
    science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs
    to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.
    Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve
    a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce
    parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.&nbsp;
    Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,
    computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.
Although parallel computing will be covered, this is not a class
    on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days
    have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead,
    the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop,
    desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and
    students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still
    be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.
Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools
    such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control
    systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and
    a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.
High performance programming is also an important aspect of high
    performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course
    is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as
    a computational scientist. Programming-oriented course on effectively using modern computers to solve scientific computing problems arising in the physical/engineering sciences and other fields. Provides an introduction to efficient serial and parallel computing using Fortran 90, OpenMP, MPI, and Python, and software development tools such as version control, Makefiles, and debugging." ,"Coursera"	"en"	
"Neural Networks for Machine Learning"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence, Statistics and Data Analysis Neural networks use learning algorithms that are inspired by our understanding of how the brain learns, but they are evaluated by how well they work for practical applications such as speech recognition, object recognition, image retrieval and the ability to recommend products that a user will like. As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images. The course will explain the new learning procedures that are responsible for these advances, including effective new proceduresr for learning multiple layers of non-linear features, and give you the skills and understanding required to apply these procedures in many other domains.  This YouTube video gives examples of the kind of material that will be in the course, but the course will present this material at a much gentler rate and with more examples.

"The Finite Element Method for Problems in Physics"	"Mathematics, Engineering SyllabusThe syllabus is outlined below. Each item is a unit consisting of between 4 and 24 segments (video lectures). A segment may be as short as one, and as long as 25 minutes. Expect to view around 3 hours of video lectures per week. There will be one paper-and-pencil, mathematical, assignment at the end of Unit 1, a quiz at the end of each Unit and 4 coding assignments. All code is to be in C++, using the open source library deal.ii.
1. Linear, elliptic partial differential equations in one dimension. Elasticity, heat conduction and mass diffusion.
2. Approximation. The finite-dimensional weak form.
3. Linear algebra; the matrix-vector form.
4. More on boundary conditions; basis functions; numerics.
5. Analysis of the finite element method.
6. Variational principles.
7. Linear, elliptic partial dierential equations for a scalar variable in three dimensions. Heat conduction and mass diffusion at steady state.
8. Lagrange basis functions and numerical quadrature in 1 through 3 dimensions.
9. Linear, elliptic, partial dierential equations for a scalar variable in two dimensions.
10. Linear, elliptic partial differential equations for vector unknowns in three dimensions (Linearized elasticity).
11. Linear, parabolic partial differential equations for a scalar unknown in three dimensions (Unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion).
12. Linear, hyperbolic partial dierential equations for a vector unknown in three dimensions (Linear elastodynamics).
Resources
You can download the deal.ii library at dealii.org. The lectures include coding tutorials where we list other resources that you can use if you are unable to install deal.ii on your own computer. You will need cmake to run deal.ii. It is available at cmake.org.
Work expectation
You should expect to watch about 3 hours of video lectures a week. The first assignment is mathematical, to be worked out by paper and pencil. It should take a few hours, depending on your background. However, it will not be graded. Each quiz will consist of 2 or 5 multiple choice questions. The remaining are coding assignments, on which there can be quite a spread in the work you have to put in, again depending on your background. Almost all students will find the coding assignments to be more demanding of their time than the first, paper-and-pencil assignment. The second, third and fourth coding assignments should actually take no more time than the first one; you will stand to gain from a modular code, which we try to encourage in the templates that you will use.
Books
There are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required textbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader treatments than can be provided in any form of class:
 The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis, T.J.R. Hughes, Dover Publications, 2000.
 The Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals, O.C. Zienkiewicz, R.L. Taylor and J.Z. Zhu, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2005.
 A First Course in Finite Elements, J. Fish and T. Belytschko, Wiley, 2007. The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an introductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not formal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a competent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional analysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the methods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite Element Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical foundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner presented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed, although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.&nbsp;The development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs): elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to the physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in one dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We then move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and mass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems in vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next (unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in three dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who followed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical development to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.&nbsp; This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences. The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently." ,"Coursera"	"en"

It is also of ever greater importance in daily life, as data of all sorts are now ubiquitous. Statistical literacy is hence of great value, both for academic purposes and for our daily routines. This course offers a solid foundation in statistical reasoning and its uses in the quantitative social sciences.Learning statistics can be a daunting experience. There is a plethora of statistical concepts to master and many of them come with a hefty dose of mathematical notation. The goal of the present course is to develop a clear path through the conceptual forest and to explain each concept both in its narrow meaning and as a part of the larger enterprise of statistical reasoning. Mathematical skills are not taken for granted; instead, we shall review the necessary mathematical tools so that you will not get stuck on this aspect.The field of statistics is sometimes divided into descriptive and inferential statistics, with probability theory forming a bridge between the two. In this course, we start out descriptively, by considering different ways in which we can learn from data. We then delve into the subject of probability theory, to end with a discussion of statistical inference. The emphasis in this part is on learning how to draw conclusions about populations with the help of data from a sample.By the end of this course, you should have a good feeling for descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and probability theory. You should also understand the interplay of these elements in the broader enterprise of statistical reasoning. And you should feel more comfortable reading about statistics and using them in your own work. This course exposes students to the logic of statistical reasoning and its application in the quantitative social sciences. It is meant as a thorough but accessible introduction to the topics of descriptive statistics, probability theory, and statistical inference with hands-on exercises." ,"Coursera"	"en"	
"General Game Playing"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, Computer Science: Theory General game players are computer systems able to play strategy games
based solely on formal game descriptions supplied at "runtime". &nbsp;(In
other words, they don't know the rules until the game starts.) &nbsp;Unlike
specialized game players, such as Deep Blue, general game players cannot
rely on algorithms designed in advance for specific games; they must discover
such algorithms themselves. &nbsp;General game playing expertise depends
on intelligence on the part of the game player and not just intelligence
of the programmer of the game player.


GGP is an interesting application in its own right. &nbsp;It is intellectually
    engaging and more than a little fun. &nbsp;But it is much more than that.
    &nbsp;It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic
    systems and for defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem
    representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and
    resource bounds. &nbsp;It has practical applications in areas where these

However, students somewhat familiar with the material in that class will be able to take this class independently. &nbsp;We start by seeing classic factor pricing models in action, first by studying the Fama French three factor model and then by studying the question whether portfolio managers have skill or not. We’ll look in depth at the time-series predictability of returns, “bubbles,” and volatility. We will study the equity premium and the link between asset pricing and macroeconomics. We’ll extend the theory to cover options, then bonds, and study the facts about the term structure of interest rates. The course closes with portfolio theory, how should investors structure their investment portfolios.&nbsp;The math in real, academic, &nbsp;finance is not actually that hard. Understanding how to use the equations, and see what they really mean about the world... that's hard, and that's what I hope will be uniquely rewarding about this class. This course is part two of an introduction to graduate-level academic asset pricing. This second part uses the theory and elaborates empirical understanding. It explores some classic applications including the Fama-French three-factor model, consumption and the equity premium, and extends the theory to cover options, bonds, and portfolios." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Mathematics Describing the Real World: Precalculus and Trigonometry - DVD course"	"What's the sure road to success in calculus? The answer is simple:
Precalculus. Traditionally studied after Algebra II, this mathematical field
covers advanced algebra, trigonometry, exponents, logarithms, and much more.
These interrelated topics are essential for solving calculus problems, and by
themselvesare powerful methods for describing the real world, permeating all
areas of science and every branch of mathematics. Little wonder, then, that
precalculus is a core course in high schools throughout the country and an
important review subject in college.Unfortunately, many students struggle in
precalculus because they fail to see the links between different
topics—between one approach to finding an answer and a startlingly different,
often miraculously simpler, technique. As a result, they lose out on the
enjoyment and fascination of mastering an amazingly useful tool box of
problem-solving strategies.And even if you're not planning to take calculus,
understanding the fundamentals of precalculus can give you a versatile set of
skills that can be applied to a wide range of fields—from computer science and
engineering to business and health care.Mathematics Describing the Real World:
Precalculus and Trigonometry is your unrivaled introduction to this crucial
subject, taught by award-winning Professor Bruce Edwards of the University of
Florida. Professor Edwards is coauthor of one of the most widely used
textbooks on precalculus and an expert in getting students over the trouble
spots of this challenging phase of their mathematics education."Calculus is
difficult because of the precalculus skills needed for success," Professor
Edwards points out, adding, "In my many years of teaching, I have found that
success in calculus is assured if students have a strong background in
precalculus."A Math Milestone Made ClearIn 36 intensively illustrated half-
hour lectures, supplemented by a workbook with additional explanations and
problems, Mathematics Describing the Real World takes you through all the
major topics of a typical precalculus course taught in high school or college.
Those who will especially benefit from Professor Edwards's lucid and engaging
approach include high school and college students currently enrolled in
precalculus who feel overwhelmed and want coaching from an inspiring teacher
who knows where students stumble; parents of students, who may feel out of
their depth with the advanced concepts taught in precalculus; those who have
finished Algebra II and are eager to get a head start on the next milestone on
the road to calculus; beginning calculus students who want to review and hone
their skills in crucial precalculus topics; anyone motivated to learn
precalculus on his or her own, whether as a home-schooled pupil or as an adult

- Building a simple LCA model using spreadsheet software- Results interpretation and reporting Paper or plastic? Local or imported food? Which is
better for the environment? To answer these questions, one must take
a holistic systems view using a quantitative approach known as life cycle
assessment.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a fundamental method for assessing the
environmental impacts of products and technologies from a "cradle to grave"
systems perspective. It is an essential tool for anyone who performs
environmental analyses or uses the results of such analyses for decision
making.&nbsp;

The course will provide an introduction to LCA methods and applications. Students taking this course will emerge with a solid understanding of why
an LCA systems perspective is important, basic skills for sound application
of the LCA method and proper interpretation of its results, and an appreciation
for the strengths and limitations of LCA in practice. The course
will cover the four major steps in LCA: (1) goal and scope definition;
(2) life-cycle inventory compilation; (3) life-cycle impact assessment;
and (4) interpretation and management. The course will include a
hands-on modeling project, which the students will perform in parallel
to the lectures to reinforce learning objectives and to gain experience
in LCA application.

"The Beauty and Joy of Computing (CS Principles), Part 1"	"Computer Science Discover the big ideas and thinking practices in computer science plus learn how to code using one of the friendliest programming languages, Snap! (based on Scratch)

Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code.

This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us!

“I am so grateful to have experienced BJC (Beauty and Joy of Computing). I took this course during my freshmen year at UC Berkeley, and it has actually changed my life. Because of it, I have switched to the computer science major and have even developed a passion for computer science education! This course showed me that computer science is creative, and it gave me the confidence to continue taking computer science courses. BJC's philosophy of inclusion, diversity, and collaboration is tangible and sets it apart from all other computer science courses that I have experienced. It is truly empowering!” -- Yifat Amir

"Discrete Time Signals and Systems, Part 1: Time Domain"	"Engineering Technological innovations have revolutionized the way we view and interact with the world around us. Editing a photo, re-mixing a song, automatically measuring and adjusting chemical concentrations in a tank: each of these tasks requires real-world data to be captured by a computer and then manipulated digitally to extract the salient information. Ever wonder how signals from the physical world are sampled, stored, and processed without losing the information required to make predictions and extract meaning from the data?

Students will find out in this rigorous mathematical introduction to the engineering field of signal processing: the study of signals and systems that extract information from the world around us. This course will teach students to analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both the time and frequency domains. Students will learn convolution, discrete Fourier transforms, the z-transform, and digital filtering. Students will apply these concepts in interactive MATLAB programming exercises (all done in browser, no download required).

Part 1 of this course analyzes signals and systems in the time domain. Part 2 covers frequency domain analysis.

Prerequisites include strong problem solving skills, the ability to understand mathematical representations of physical systems, and advanced mathematical background (one-dimensional integration, matrices, vectors, basic linear algebra, imaginary numbers, and sum and series notation). Part 1 is a prerequisite for Part 2. This course is an excerpt from an advanced undergraduate class at Rice University taught to all electrical and computer engineering majors.

"The Civil War and Reconstruction | edXhtml"	"History XSeries Program Overview

Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. This XSeries will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.

Yet the problem is even more complex than it may appear ... to solve it, we will need to travel back in time to meet three famous mathematicians, and learn about algorithms based on graph theory.Later in the course, we will see that sequencing genomes is not the only task related to decoding biological macromolecules.&nbsp; Another difficult problem is sequencing antibiotics, short mini-proteins engineered by bacteria to fight each other.&nbsp; Even though antibiotics often contain fewer than 10 amino acids, sequencing them is a formidable challenge.&nbsp;Decoding the sequence of amino acids making up an antibiotic is an important biomedical problem, but the practical barriers to sequencing short antibiotics are often more substantial than barriers to assembling a genome with millions of&nbsp; nucleotides! To address this computational challenge, we will learn about brute force algorithms that often succeed in various bioinformatics applications.Finally in this course, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to assemble a deadly Staphylococcus bacterium. You will also be introduced to the popular cloud service BaseSpace offered by Illumina, the leading DNA sequencing company, thus joining the thousands of biologists and bioinformaticians who use BaseSpace every day. Biologists still cannot read the nucleotides of an entire genome as you would read a book from beginning to end. However, they can read short pieces of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces. We will further learn about brute force algorithms and apply them to sequencing mini-proteins called antibiotics. Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to sequence the genome of a deadly Staphylococcus bacterium." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Control of Mobile Robots"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence, Engineering This course investigates how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, and predictable ways. The basic tool for achieving this is "control theory", which deals with the question of how dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose behaviors change over time, can be effectively influenced. In the course, these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory, via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations, &nbsp;(2) how to make aerial, quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances, and (3) how to locomotive bipedal, humanoid robots.While the main focus of this course is theory, it is important to be able to map the theory onto an actual physical platform. As such, the course&nbsp;will provide detailed instructions on how to build a mobile robot from scratch as an optional part of the course. In addition, an introduction into microcontrollers, mechatronics, and electronics will be given so that, by the end of the course, the controllers developed in the course can run on an actual mobile robot.The course will also feature optional programming assignments, which will&nbsp;focus on implementing the controllers developed in this course for a&nbsp;mobile robot.

"Nanotechnology: Fundamentals of Nanotransistors"	"Engineering Course Syllabus
        Weeks 1 & 2: Transistor FundamentalsWeeks 3 & 4: MOS ElectrostatisticsWeeks 5 & 6: The Ballistic NanotransistorWeeks 7 & 8: The Transmission Theory of the MOSFET The transistor has been called the greatest invention of the 20th century – it enables the electronics systems that have shaped the world we live in. Today’s nanotransistors are a high volume, high impact success of the nanotechnology revolution. If you are interested in understanding how this scientifically interesting and technologically important nano-device operates, this course is for you!

This nanotechnology course provides a simple, conceptual framework for understanding the essential physics of nanoscale transistors.  It assumes only a basic background in semiconductor physics and provides an opportunity to learn how some of the fascinating new discoveries about the flow of electrons at the nanoscale plays out in the context of a practical device.

The course is divided into four units:

Transistors fundamentals
	Transistor electrostatics
	Ballistic MOSFETs
	Transmission theory of the MOSFET
The first two units provide an introduction for students with no background in transistors or a quick review for those familiar with transistors.  The third unit treats the ballistic transistor in which electrons move without resistance (in the traditional sense). The last unit uses that Landauer Approach to electron transport, which was developed to understand some striking experiments in nanophysics, to develop an understanding of how electrons flow in modern nanotransistors.  This short course describes a way of understanding MOSFETs that is much more suitable than traditional approaches when the channel lengths are of nanoscale dimensions. Surprisingly, the final result looks much like the traditional, textbook, MOSFET model, but the parameters in the equations have simple, clear interpretations at the nanoscale.

My objective for this course is to provide students with an understanding of the essential physics of nanoscale transistors as well as some of the practical technological considerations and fundamental limits. The goal is to do this in a way that is broadly accessible to students with only a very basic knowledge of semiconductor physics and electronic circuits. The course is designed for anyone seeking a sound, physical, but simple understanding of how nanoscale transistors operate. The course should be useful for advanced undergraduates, beginning graduate students, as well as researchers and practicing engineers and scientists.

This course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams. Transistor fundamentals (IV characteristics and device metrics)

"History and Future of (Mostly) Higher Education"	"Information, Tech & Design Learning Objectives


    Understand how and why we inherited the Industrial Age educational systems.
    Think deeply about the requirements of the world we live in now.
    Discover new ideas, methods, competencies, and subject matter.
    Share our pathways to successful innovation with others around the world.  Together, we can change schools, classrooms, institutions, learning--and maybe ourselves!  
    

WEEK ONE - January 27, 2014Guiding Principles and Driving Concepts - Let’s Get Started
    This week we will think about the uses of history: learning how and why educational institutions were constructed in the past helps us think about what we need now, in order to begin to shape a different future of education in order to help shape a more just future for all.
WEEK TWO - February 3, 2014The iPod Experiment: Or, Learning vs. Education
    Duke University’s iPod experiment became international news.  Why?  What happens when students are in charge?  What happens when education begins at a place where no one (not even the instructor) knows the answer in advance? What if
    the actual learning cannot be tested or assessed by the usual methods of higher education? What if learning is also about trying to improve the status quo?  This week we will look at diverse histories and theories of education and learning.
    


WEEK THREE - February 10, 2014Teaching Like It’s 1992    
    The World changed on April 22, 1993, when the scientists at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications released the Internet and the World Wide Web to the general public.  From then on, anyone with access to an Internet connection could
    communicate  to anyone else with an Internet connection.  No editor or publisher provides a safety net now and, at the same time, our data can be hacked, our privacy invaded.  The digital world we live in now comes with tremendous responsibilities and opportunity--and yet it comes with real inequalities, perils, and obstacles too.  Does our educational system prepare us for these challenges?
    



WEEK FOUR - February 17, 2014Welcome to the Future: 10 Ways to Change the Paradigm of Higher Education
    We will now be looking at different principles, methods and metrics for redesigning an innovative form of learning that helps us all navigate the complexities of the world we inhabit outside of school.  This week we focus specifically on innovations
    to the curriculum.
    



WEEK FIVE - February 24, 2014Innovations in Pedagogy (Methods) and Assessment
    This week we will focus on innovations in pedagogy (the methods for learning) and assessment.  How you teach is what you teach.  And, we need to think deeply about what we value and make sure what we value is what we count.    
    

WEEK SIX - March 3, 2014How to Make Institutional Change 
    Even if we make changes in our personal learning and teaching methods, we still have to work mostly within institutions of learning.  Institutional change can be difficult; it takes patience, strategy, and allies. This week offers (and also invites)
    ideas about what we can do together. It makes a powerful argument that we all need to advocate (in any country) for higher education and shows how, in the U.S., the decline in support for public education has contributed to income inequality and hurt all our future.  This week includes interviews with inspiring people who have worked together to make successful change happen in society ad in education, against odds.  



Conclusion: Thank you for joining this movement on behalf of educational innovation and reform!  This is not the end.  It’s the beginning.  Where will we do from here? Let’s get started!  Welcome!  This course is designed for anyone concerned with the best ways of learning and thriving in the world we live in now.  It's for students, teachers, professors, researchers, administrators, policy makers, business leaders, job counselors and recruiters, parents, and lifelong learners around the globe.  The full,  whimsical name of the class is: “The History and Future of (Mostly) Higher Education: Or, How We Can Unlearn Our Old Patterns and Relearn for a Happier, More Productive, Ethical, and Socially-Engaged Future.”  That subtitle is inspired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen who has said that "all education is vocational" in the sense that it is our job, as educators, to help train people for the vocation of leading better lives.  Are we fulfilling that educational objective, from kindergarten to professional school?  Or are we training students with the methods, philosophy, and metrics designed for the Fordist era of the Model T?  Since 1993, when scientists made the Internet widely available, our lives, our work, our occupations, our culture, and our entertainments have changed tremendously.  Far too little has changed inside our educational institutions, in the US and internationally, to prepare us for the demands, problems, restrictions, obstacles,  responsibilities, and possibilities of living in the world we inhabit outside of school.  This course addresses one key question:  How can we all, together, work to redesign higher education for our future... not for someone else’s past? Bonus: Students enrolled in this Coursera course will also be invited to many onsite and online events, workshops, and conferences offered by more than fifty learning institutions around the world, as part of an initiative on Shaping the Future of Higher Education. In this course we will learn about the features of higher education that were designed specifically to prepare workers and leaders for the Industrial Age, and we’ll strategize ways that, together, we can change learning--inside of school and out--for the world we live in now--and even to help improve our world. #FutureEd" ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Discrete Inference and Learning in Artificial Vision"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence Lecture
1: Introduction to artificial vision with discrete graphical models: In this lecture, the interdisciplinary nature of
computational vision is briefly introduced along with its potential use in
different application domains. Subsequently, the concept of discrete modeling
of artificial vision tasks is introduced from theoretical view point along with
short examples demonstrating the interest of such an approach in low, mid and
high-level vision. Examples refer to blind image deconvolution, knowledge-based
image segmentation, optical flow, graph matching, 2d-to-3d view-point invariant
detection and modeling and grammar-driven image based reconstruction.Lecture
2: Reparameterization and dynamic programming: In this lecture, we provide a brief introduction to
undirected graphical models. We also provide a formal definition of the problem
of inference (specifically, energy minimization). We introduce the concept of
reparameterization, which forms the building block of all the inference
algorithms discussed in the course. We describe a simple inference algorithm
known as dynamic programming, which consists of a series of reparameterization.
We show how dynamic programming can be used to perform exact inference on
chains.


 Lecture
3: Maximum flow and minimum cut:&nbsp; In this lecture, we introduce the concept of functions on arcs of a directed graph. We
focus on a special function known as the flow function. Associated with this
function is the combinatorial optimization problem of computing the maximum
flow of a directed graph. We also introduce the concept of a cut in a directed
graph, and prove that the minimum cost cut is equivalent to the maximum flow.
We describe a simple algorithm for solving the maximum flow, or equivalent the
minimum cut, problem.Lecture
4: Minimum cut based inference: In this lecture, we show how the problem of inference for undirected
graphical models with two labels can be formulated as a minimum cut problem. We
characterize the energy function that can be minimized optimally using the
minimum cut problem. We show examples using the image segmentation and texture
synthesis problems, which can be formulated using two labels. We consider the
multi-label problem, and devise approximate algorithms for inference based on
the minimum cut algorithms. We show examples using the stereo reconstruction
and the image denoising problems.
Lecture
5: Belief propagation: In this lecture we present the basic concepts of
message passing and belief propagation networks. The concept is initially
demonstrated using chains, extended to the case of trees and then eventually to
arbitrary graphs. The strengths and the limitations of such an optimization
framework are presented. The image completion and texture synthesis problems
are considered as examples to demonstrate the interest of such a family of
optimization algorithms.
Lecture
6: Linear programing and duality:&nbsp; In this lecture, discrete inference is addressed through concepts coming
from linear programming relaxations. In particular, we explain how a
graph-optimization problem can be expressed as a linear programing one and then
how one can take benefit of the duality theorem to develop efficient
optimization methods. The problem of optical flow and its deformable
registration variant in medical image analysis is considered as an example to
demonstrate the interest of such optimization algorithms.Lecture
7: Dual decomposition and higher order graphs: In this lecture, we introduce the dual decomposition
framework for the optimization of low rank and higher order graphical models.
First, we demonstrate the concept of the method using a simple toy example and
then we extend to the most general optimization problem case. Three different
examples are considered in the context of higher order optimization, the
problem of linear mapping between images, the case of dense deformable graph
matching and the development of pose invariant object segmentation methods in
the context of medical imaging.
Lecture 8: Parameter learning: In this lecture, we introduce two frameworks for estimating the parameters
of a graphical model using fully supervised training data. The first framework
maximizes the likelihood of the training data while regularizing the
parameters. The second framework minimizes the empirical risk, as measured by a
user-defined loss function, while regularizing the parameters. We provide a
brief description of the algorithms required to solve the related optimization
problems. We show the results obtained on standard machine learning
datasets. Artificial
vision applications, such as object detection in natural images and automatic
segmentation of medical acquisitions, rely on models that interpret the visual
information provided to a computer. The model provides a compromise between the
support given by the observations and the prior domain knowledge. This course
is concerned with the two computational problems that arise when using such models
in practice.

Inference
(Energy Minimization):

Given a visual observation (for example, an image or an MRI scan), we
are interested in estimating its most likely interpretation (i.e. the location of all
the objects in the image, or the segments of the MRI scan) according to the
model. While the problem cannot be solved optimally, we will describe state of the art approximate algorithms that provide very accurate solutions in
practice. While the theoretical properties of the algorithms will be discussed
briefly, the main emphasis will be on their application.

 Learning
(Parameter Estimation):

Given a set of training samples consisting of inputs and their desired
outputs, (for example, images and the location of the objects, or MRI scans and
their segmentations) we would like to estimate a model that is suited to the
task at hand. We will show how the problem of learning a model can be
formulated as empirical risk minimization. Furthermore, we will present
efficient algorithms for solving the corresponding optimization problem. We will present the state of the art energy minimization algorithms that are used to perform inference in modern artificial vision models: that is, efficient methods for obtaining the most likely interpretation of a given visual input. We will also cover the popular max-margin framework for estimating the model parameters using inference." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Week 5-6. Final exam and final problem set. Popularized by movies such as
"A Beautiful Mind", game theory is the mathematical modeling of
strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents.  Over four weeks of lectures, this advanced course considers how to design
interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three
main topics are covered:  social choice
theory (i.e., collective decision making), mechanism design, and auctions. 



In the first week we consider the problem of
aggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the
challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most
important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which
proves that there is no "perfect" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite
and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We
move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are
self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain
"mechanism design" -- a broad framework for designing interactions
between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our
third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate
happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The
course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating
scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an
introduction to auction theory.  This advanced course considers how to design interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making), mechanism design, and auctions." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Transformation to Hybrid Landscapes"	"SAP’s clients are increasingly interested in adopting cloud solutions. The prediction from IDC is that more than 65% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid cloud technologies before 2016. Companies that use SAP solutions can now choose between on-premise, cloud, and hybrid deployments – a combination of both on-premise and cloud. This freedom of choice allows companies to transform at their own pace, following their business priorities and markets, which can change at any time.If you’re asking yourself questions like “how do I get there?”, “what does the hybrid deployment model mean for my security and operations teams?” and “how can I ensure sufficient integration between the different environments?” then this openSAP course is for you. The questions are highly company-specific, so there is no one correct answer to them all. However, the aim of this openSAP course is to give you an understanding for what running a hybrid landscape means for integration, security, and operations, and how you can start your own hybrid transformation journey.Week 1 will provide you with an introduction to cloud and hybrid deployments.Week 2 offers a deep dive into the topic of integration, where we will give you an overview of the different integration technologies before going on to compare them.In week 3, we will talk about the security aspects you should consider in order to ensure that the data in your hybrid landscape is secure.In week 4, the focus will be on operating the new environment. How do operative tasks change when you move from an on-premise environment to a hybrid landscape?The course concludes with week 5 – the transformation. Here, the topics of adoption, organizational impact, strategy, and roadmap will be discussed." ,"coursetalk"	"en"

"Systematic Program Design | edXhtml"	"Computer Science XSeries Program Overview

This XSeries presents a programming method that will enable you to produce well-structured programs — programs that tell a clear story about what they do, are well tested, and are easy for others to improve. This series differs from other online programming courses by focusing on a general design method, rather than how to program in a specific language.
 
The approach is practical and hands on; most of your work in these courses will consist of you writing programs using the design method. Part 1 begins with simple programs, which many programmers could easily write without using the design method. By the end of Part 1 you will have learned the core of the design method, and will be ready to apply it to more challenging problems. In Part 2 you will learn about more elaborate forms of data and you will begin to learn how to independently expand your understanding of the design method. And in Part 3, you will apply the design method to programs that would challenge even experienced programmers.
 
The series is designed for beginners who have never programmed before. But at the same time, many experienced programmers have taken these courses, and reported that it made them better programmers. So you can take these courses as an introduction to programming, or later in your career to enhance your skills.

This is a series of 3 courses that are best taken in order. If the current start dates are inconvenient, please check back often as they are always being added.

"Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story"	"Computer Science: Software Engineering, Computer Science: Systems & Security Week One: Introduction to Malicious SoftwareWeek Two: (A Glimpse at) Static Analysis and its LimitationWeek Three: (A Glimpse at) Dynamic Analysis and its LimitationWeek Four: Introduction to Mobile Malware ThreatsWeek Five: Specialized Underground CybercrimeWeek Six: Cybercrime economy (and its costs) Cybercrime has become both more widespread and harder to battle. Researchers and anecdotal
experience show that the cybercrime scene is becoming increasingly organized
and consolidated, with strong links also to traditional criminal networks.
Modern attacks are indeed stealthy and often profit oriented.

Malicious software (malware) is the traditional way in which cybercriminals infect user
and enterprise hosts to gain access to their private, financial, and
intellectual property data. Once stolen, such information can enable more
sophisticated attacks, generate illegal revenue, and allow for cyber-espionage.
By mixing a practical, hands-on approach with the theory and techniques behind the scene, the course discusses the current academic and underground research in the
field, trying to answer the foremost question about malware and underground
economy, namely, "Should we care?". Students will learn how traditional and mobile malware work, how they are analyzed and
detected, peering through the underground ecosystem that drives this profitable
but illegal business.

Understanding how malware operates is of paramount importance to form knowledgeable experts, teachers, researchers, and practitioners able to fight back.  Besides, it allows us to gather intimate knowledge of the systems and the threats, which is a necessary step to successfully devise novel, effective, and practical mitigation techniques. Learn about traditional and mobile malware, the security threats they represent, state-of-the-art analysis and detection techniques, and the underground ecosystem that drives such a profitable but illegal business." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"TC344: 3D Printing for Social Good"	"3D printing is primed to change our physical world. Twenty years after the
Internet and cell phones fundamentally changed how humans communicate with
each other and exchange information, this new technology is set to
revolutionize the way that we make products by bringing factory to the people
and ushering in a new era of innovation and creativity in manufacturing.

As 3D printers become more sophisticated and affordable and a number of
patents expire, their potential to assist in response to global development
and humanitarian challenges increases dramatically. Already 3D printers have
been used to print low-cost soft-tissue prosthetics and medical supplies like
customized tracheal valves, umbilical cord clamps, and splints. Efforts are
underway to make it possible to print things like solar panels, greenhouses,
dental implants, and more.

This four-week online certificate course will explore case studies across a
range of sectors from disaster response to health, to agriculture, and energy.
It will attempt to address questions like: can 3D printing truly provide
significant reductions in supply chain time and costs? How might it be
introduced inclusively into communities so as not to augment the digital
divide? How long before it can effectively benefit the world’s most
marginalized individuals?

The course will provide a basic introduction to the technical fundamentals of
3D printing and assist you in connecting with local maker spaces and 3D
printing communities in your country. It will also consider various obstacles
to adoption including: supply chain challenges, insufficient electricity and

"Next Steps in Software Development on SAP HANA"	"SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform that is deployable either as an
appliance or in the cloud. At its core, it is an innovative, in-memory,
relational database management system that exploits all the capabilities of
current hardware to increase application performance, reduce total cost of
ownership, and enable new scenarios and applications that were not possible
before.SAP HANA enables you to build applications that integrate the business
logic, the control logic, and the database layer with unprecedented
performance. As a developer, one of the key issues is how to minimize data
movements. The more you can do directly on the data in memory next to the
CPUs, the better the application will perform.This course will build upon last
year’s Introduction to Software Development on SAP HANA course and go deeper
into each of the major topics around SAP HANA native development. We will
explore the many advances in the programming model and tooling that came with
SAP HANA SPS6, SPS7, and SPS8.

During the course, we will use SAP HANA studio as well as several new Web-

Complex analysis is the study of functions that live in the complex plane, i.e. functions that have complex arguments and complex outputs. In order to study the behavior of such functions we’ll need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. We’ll begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons? Once we’ve answered these questions we’ll devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers, how they behave in limiting processes, etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions, and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of 
these that’s quite alright, but do look at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set for example to see some 
beautiful pictures).When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation – a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Don’t worry! We’ll help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.&nbsp; After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places, a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We’ll explore these properties! Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly we’ll have to learn about integration as well. But we are in the complex plane, so what are the objects we’ll integrate over? Curves! We’ll study these as well, and we’ll tie everything together via Cauchy’s beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.&nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout this course we'll tell you about some of the major theorems in the field (even if we won't be able to go into depth about them) as well as some outstanding conjectures.  In this course we’ll explore complex analysis, complex dynamics, and some applications of these topics." ,"Coursera"	"en"

    the ethics that emanate from the selected definitions of moral behavior. There is no dearth of defined moral behavior created by religions and their leaders, business persons, politicians, philosophers, and in some cases “the everyday person on the
    street”.
    
    

Example technologies at play today include nuclear energy; biological manipulations for warfare; robots for taking care of the elderly, and enhancing human capability; the use of technology for surveillance; the cultural changing power of the media which
    can create unlimited arrays of images real and virtual to support a point of view; and the internet with its world wide connectivity.
    
    We need to look into social/technology assessment, the transfer of the technology as it is placed into practice, and the techniques/processes that are available for control within the legal, political, institutional and attitudinal environment within
    which the technology is placed as a way of protecting our rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. 
    
    
 The meteoric rise of technologies used in our everyday life for profit, power, or improvement of an individual's life can, on occasion, cause cultural stress as well as ethical challenges.  In this course, we will explore how these multifaceted impacts might be understood, controlled and mitigated." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Algorithmic Thinking (Part 1)"	"Computer Science: Software Engineering, Computer Science: Theory Our course syllabus can be viewed at www.codeskulptor.org/coursera/algorithmicthinking.html. When presented with a problem from a scientific domain, a Computer Scientist goes through a set of steps in order to provide a solution for the problem. These steps include: (1) understanding the problem; (2) formulating the problem mathematically; (3) designing an algorithm; (4) implementing the algorithm; and (5) solving the original scientific problem. This course will train students in how to employ algorithmic thinking by following these five steps to solve real-world problems.&nbsp;Understanding the problem entails holding conversations with domain experts to understand the parameters of the problem, what data they can provide to the computer program, what answers they expect, etc. Formulating the problem mathematically is basically the step of turning the problem from an English description to a mathematical description that is amenable to further computational analyses.&nbsp;While the course emphasizes implementing the algorithms and solving the original problems that gave rise to the need for these algorithms in the first place, much of this two-part course (part 2 is available here) will be devoted to the third step, namely, algorithm design. Here, the course will introduce students to different algorithm design strategies, as well as mathematical tools for reasoning about the correctness and efficiency of algorithms. &nbsp; Experienced Computer Scientists analyze and solve computational problems at a level of abstraction that is beyond that of any particular programming language.  This two-part class is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of "Algorithmic Thinking", allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to computational problems." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Underactuated Robotics"	"Computer Science Robots today move far too conservatively, using control systems that attempt to maintain full control authority at all times. Humans and animals move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions which involve a loss of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural dynamics of our machines.
This course introduces nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, with an emphasis on computational methods. Topics include the nonlinear dynamics of robotic manipulators, applied optimal and robust control and motion planning. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.

Week 3: Solutions–A Prevention Framework for PHL
This module will introduce a conceptual framework for how losses can be prevented. Theories, methods, and case examples on prevention will be covered.

Week 4: Actors–A Network of Global Stakeholders
This module will explore how the international community is responding to the issue of postharvest loss. It will cover the current state of the postharvest loss prevention field, as well as provide background as to how it developed. Some key projects, initiatives, and approaches will be highlighted. Each year, estimates suggest that 1/3 of all food produced is lost or wasted, making postharvest loss a critical global food security and sustainability issue of today. Key knowledge areas are presented including:

An overview of postharvest loss
Supply chain activities such as harvesting, drying, and storage
Economics and markets
An introduction to the network of actors working in this field


We face the immense challenge of feeding over 9 billion people by the year 2050. To meet these demands, yields will have to more than double using the same amount of natural resources. In recent years, postharvest loss has been recognized by major institutions including the US government, the United Nations, the CGIAR Research Consortium, and several others as a significant opportunity to impact food security and improve livelihoods. Despite this increased attention, a lack of knowledge, technical capacity, and resources remain obstacles for stakeholders worldwide to act on these issues. This course will, for the first time, provide you as professionals, practitioners, and students, with a comprehensive introduction to postharvest loss processes and begin building capacity for loss prevention worldwide.

This course introduces acoustics by using the concept of impedance. It starts with vibrations and waves, demonstrating how vibrations can be envisaged as a kind of wave, mathematically and physically. The essential measures for acoustic waves, such as dB scale, octave scale, acoustic pressure, energy, intensity, will also be explained. These measures are realized by one-dimensional examples, which provide clear and simple physical insights.The course then moves on to explaining waves on a flat surface of discontinuity, demonstrating how propagation characteristics of waves change in space where there is a distributed impedance mismatch.&nbsp;Subsequent topics are radiation, scattering, and diffraction, which can be explained in a unified way by seeing the changes of waves due to spatially distributed impedance. Lastly, the course covers sound in closed space, which is considered to be a space that is surrounded by spatially distributed impedance, and introduces two spaces: acoustically large and small space. In Part 1, we will handle topics from vibrations and waves to waves on a flat surface of discontinuity. The later&nbsp;parts will be&nbsp;covered in Part 2.This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in acoustics, audio engineering, and noise control engineering. Practicing engineers and researchers in audio engineering and noise control, or students in engineering and physics disciplines, who want to gain an understanding of sound and vibration concepts, are also welcome. Learn about acoustics and sound fields by using the concept of impedance.

"Introduction to Functional Programming"	"Computer Science Broadly speaking, functional programming is a style of programming in which the primary method of computation is the application of functions to arguments. Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.

Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, … support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.

This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.

Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to “think like a fundamentalist”, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to “code like a hacker” in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook’s novel Hack language as our main example. This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.

"Engaging Citizens: A Game Changer for Development?"	"Information, Tech & Design Overview 
The overview will provide a course roadmap and explain the rationale behind this course—why this topic, and why now?

Week 1: Citizen Engagement: What It Is and Why It Matters
 
This week examines the theoretical underpinnings of citizen engagement and how it can lead to better development results. We begin by exploring the definitions and history of citizen engagement, as well as related concepts such as transparency, accountability, responsiveness and inclusiveness. We then look at the concept of the feedback loop, and the differences between intrinsic and instrumental approaches. Next we examine the crucial role of sociopolitical context and the enabling environment, and finally introduce the concept of strategic and tactical approaches to citizen engagement.

Week 2: Engaging Citizens for Improved Policymaking
This week explores the role that citizens can play in actively shaping public policy. We start by examining how citizens participate, analyzing the differences between ‘thick’ and ‘thin’ forms of engagement and asking strategic questions such as who should participate, how should participants interact with decision makers, what information do participants need, and how will participation impact policy decisions. Next, we survey examples of crowdsourcing and open innovation that are helping governments and citizens better interact. Finally, we unpack why citizens participate, moving beyond the mere calculation of costs and benefits described in the rational choice model to an analysis of broader factors that influence participation.

Week 3: Can Engaging Citizens Bring Better Services?
In this week we examine the role of citizen engagement in public service delivery. We first unpack different conceptions of the government-citizen relationship and then explore the ways citizens can serve as active agents of, rather than passive recipients in, the delivery of public services. We then provide an in-depth look at a range of citizen engagement projects in this area by exploring the methods, tools, barriers to inclusion and factors for success of case studies, particularly in developing country contexts.

Week 4: Innovations in Citizen Engagement
Having outlined the role of citizen engagement during policymaking and service delivery, the final week investigates recent innovations in citizen engagement. We begin by examining how recent advances in information and communications technology (ICT) can be used to enhance citizen engagement from a human development perspective, and review some of the most compelling new developments in this area. Next, we explore the reasons why some of these innovative approaches succeed while others fail, and look at how hybrid approaches-those that combine ICT tools with traditional methodologies-are being used in an attempt to maximize development results. Finally, we look at recent ICT-enabled citizen engagement case studies to assess their real-world impact.

We conclude the course with review videos, as well as ‘call to action’ videos from high-profile leaders in government, civil society and academia  to provide you with tangible next steps to put your knowledge into practice.

Sign up for free accounts for these services at http://www.twitter.com and http://www.linkedin.com. Recent events have shown that the relationship between government and citizens is in need of repair. In just the last few years, we have witnessed calls from all over the world, from the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street to the Open Government Partnership, for governments to become more open, accountable and responsive by deepening their engagement with citizens. As a result, interest in citizen engagement programs for effective development has gained momentum. This MOOC has been developed to explore what is meant by citizen engagement and how it can be used to enhance development impact.
The 4-week course brings together a diverse range of experts to provide students with a comprehensive overview of citizen engagement. It begins by synthesizing the theories and concepts that underlie citizen engagement, and goes on to explore how citizens can be engaged in both policymaking and public service delivery. Finally, it investigates how recent innovations are shaking up the field, through detailing both successes and failures of these new approaches. Our presenters, leaders in academia, government, and civil society, provide a wide range of perspectives and real-world experience to give participants a deeper understanding of whether citizen engagement can truly enhance the process of development. Participants will also have the opportunity to collaborate with one another and design their own citizen engagement initiatives, thereby putting theories learned in the course into practice.

Given that much of the material in these courses is reused from session to session, our goal in this capstone class is to provide a conclusion to the specialization that allows each student an opportunity to demonstrate their individual mastery of the material in the specialization.With this objective in mind, the focus in this capstone class will be a capstone exam. Each session of the course will administer an original version of this exam with the class forums being closed while the exam is being taken. This approach is designed to help insure that each student is solving the exam problems on his/her own without outside help. For students that have done their own work, we do not anticipate that the exam will be particularly hard. However, those students who have relied too heavily on outside help in previous classes may have a difficult time.

It is the enabler of any software, algorithm, or communication protocols. All the computation will eventually be carried out by hardware, namely the processor or the circuits.In this course, we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective. We will start with a short survey of the roles of hardware in security and trust. With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits, known as co-processors, being developed to speed up application specific computations, hardware’s role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays, hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However, current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently, we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems.  Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats. We conclude with the basic principles and practical methods of design for security and trust, as well as a study of the associated design cost. &nbsp;Next, we introduce physical attacks to popular digital systems such as smart cards and FPGA-based systems. We will focus on side-channel attacks, which have been demonstrated many times to be able to successfully reveal the secret cryptographic keys stored in the secure systems. These attacks include power analysis, timing attacks, and electromagnetic attacks. Standard countermeasures to these attacks will also be introduced. Finally we will learn the new hardware security primitives that can help us to build secure systems. We will see how the trust platform module (TPM) works; what is a silicon physical unclonable function (PUF) and why it is useful for system security; what is a hardware Trojan horse and the security threats it brings to the system; why counterfeiting becomes a serious problem for hardware design intellectual property protection. Upon completing the course, students will understand the vulnerabilities in current digital system design flow and the physical attacks to these systems. They will learn that security starts from hardware design and be familiar with the tools and skills to build secure and trusted hardware.  In this course, we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective.

 Introduction to Engineering Mathematics
 
Mathematics is an integral part of engineering and Engineering Mathematics is the process of applying the principles of mathematics to solve real life engineering problems.  A reference textbook will be used for this part of the course and is entitled “Introductory Mathematics for Engineering Applications” by Kuldip S. Rattan and Nathan W. Klingbeil. Publisher: John Wiley and Sons, ISBN:978-1-118-14180-9.
 
Topics to be covered in mathematics will include: application of algebra in engineering in linear and quadratic equations, trigonometry in motion of robots, application of complex numbers in electrical circuits, use of systems of equations to solve problems in statics, dynamics and DC circuits. Concepts of derivatives will be introduced and its application in engineering problems such as dynamics, electrical circuits and mechanics will be explored. In a similar fashion concepts of integrals will be examined in the context of engineering applications such as statics, dynamics and electrical circuits. The intent of this course is not to establish mastery of mathematics but rather develop an understanding of the role played by mathematics to help solve engineering problems. Participants in this course will have a better understanding of calculus and differential equations and their relevance in solving engineering problems as they progress in their engineering education.Learn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses.

"Process Mining: Data science in Action"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence, Information, Tech & Design, Statistics and Data Analysis This course starts with an overview
of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making
and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a
bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an
introductory level with various practical assignments.

The course covers the three main
types of process mining.&nbsp;The first type of process mining is discovery. A
discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without
using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an
event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.&nbsp;The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process
model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking
can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model
and vice versa.The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea
is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the
actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking
measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process
mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the
extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing
bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also
online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the
detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place.
Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially
executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information
of similar cases.

Process mining provides not only a
bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to
address the classical divide between "business" and "IT".
Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to
create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems
development.

The course uses many examples using
real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking
this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good
understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.After taking this course you should:- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),- understand the role of Big Data in today’s society,- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner. Data science is the profession of the
future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way
will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data
analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process
mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g.,
simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric
analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining
seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and
process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has
become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational
processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing
treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a
multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using a booking
site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user
interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that
dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this
as "data science in action".

The course explains the key analysis
techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery
algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw
event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will
be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life
data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of
application domains. Process mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Modern astronomy has made some astonishing discoveries - how stars burn and how black holes form; galaxies from the edge of the universe and killer rocks right next door; where the elements come from and how the expanding universe is accelerating. But
    how do we know all that? The truth is that astronomy would be impossible without technology, and every advance in astronomy is really an advance in technology. But the technology by itself is not enough. We have to apply it critically with a knowledge
    of physics to unlock the secrets of the Universe.
    Each week we will cover a different aspect of Astronomical technology, matching each piece of technology to a highlight science result.   We will explain how the technology works, how it has allowed us to collect astronomical data, and, with
    some basic physics, how we the interpret the data to make scientific discoveries.  How astronomy really works - an overview of the technology that astronomers use to collect and measure light from the universe, and how it is used in practice to make scientific discoveries." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Social networks pervade our social and economic lives.   They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally.   The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do.  This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.The course begins with some empirical background on social and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used to describe and measure networks.   Next, we will cover a set of models of how networks form, including random network models as well as strategic formation models, and some hybrids.   We will then discuss a series of models of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences. Learn how to model social and economic networks and their impact on human behavior.  How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors?   We will bring together models and techniques from economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics and computer science to answer these questions." ,"Coursera"	"en"

We illustrate by example how key pattern and framework concepts and relationships are applied in Android from both an application and infrastructure perspective. Many code examples are shown throughout using Java, with case study projects used to reify the key points throughout all the material in this MOOC.The PDF versions of all the slides used in the MOOC will be available online as the videos become available on the MOOC website. This MOOC describes by example how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques. A pattern describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. A framework is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related apps or services. &nbsp;Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of patterns that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code.This MOOC will cover Android's Handlers, Messages, and Runnables (HaMeR) framework and its AsyncTask framework, which simplify the development of Android applications that can run long-duration operations in background threads and then publish the results of these operations to the User Interface thread, which then performs short-duration user-facing operations. &nbsp;Some coverage of Java threads will be included to provide background on concurrent programming. Hands-on programming projects will require students to apply these two concurrency frameworks to representative Android applications.The Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) SpecializationThis is the third course of the six-course Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA) Specialization. It has been designed as part of a Coursera Specialization designed to help learners create complex, cloud-based Android Applications, and includes a final “capstone” project for those who earn Verified Certificates across all six courses.Note: We are proud to announce that the MoCCA specialization has already reached hundreds of thousands of learners around the globe. In its last iteration, we worked with Google to provide Nexus tablets, feedback from the Google App team, and the potential to be featured in the Google Play store to top course completers.This time around, we are providing more flexibility for all of you busy learners. We are running the Programming Mobile Applications courses in more digestible one-month-long sections, each with a meaningful mini-project at the end. Additionally, we will be re-offering the courses more frequently. For example, new sessions of my two introductory courses will be launched on a monthly basis, so that you can find a convenient time to join us or pick up where you left off if you didn’t quite finish before.For previous MoCCA students: If you have already earned a Verified Certificate in the previous version of this course, "Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems” offered in May 2014, you do not need to retake this course to continue towards the Specialization certificate and final project in 2015. Please consult the Specializations Help Center or contact the Coursera support team if you are not sure whether you qualify.This MOOC and six others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera platform, structured as follows:The first two MOOCs by Dr. Adam Porter, of the University of Maryland, are Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems Part 1 and Part 2. They focus on the design and programming of user-facing applications. &nbsp;The third, fourth. and fifth MOOCs by Dr. Douglas Schmidt, of Vanderbilt University, are Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Concurrency, Communication, and Content.&nbsp;They focus on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services. &nbsp;The sixth and seventh MOOCs by Dr. Jules White, of Vanderbilt University, are Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems: Spring and Security. &nbsp;They focus on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. The final “capstone” project will require students to develop a complex mobile cloud computing application from the ground up.Some of the programming assignments for these MOOCs will be coordinated. &nbsp;If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud. In this MOOC, we will learn how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent applications on mobile devices running Android that connect to popular cloud computing platforms." ,"Coursera"	"en"

non-profit, or government:&nbsp;
Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. It
starts a “conversation” with users and stakeholders inside and outside
an organization.&nbsp; Conversations are the natural way people think about
complex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop “stories,”
which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy
practitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises – in all departments
and sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.

In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that
if they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their
job descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier
– creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is
valued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their
enterprise stand out.

Regardless of their area of work, position or expertise, Content Strategy
practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile
media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,
actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic
content they produce enhances the user’s lives and&nbsp;deepens their
understanding and engagement with the organization.

Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it
is done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,
trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.
Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional
journalism under-serves or does not reach.&nbsp; The Content Strategy MOOC is for professionals at all levels of a for-profit, non-profit, volunteer or government organization who want to significantly improve their abilities to understand audiences and develop strategic words, pictures, graphics, and videos to convey their organization’s most important goals." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, Engineering Week 1- Introduction to Image and Video Processing: We will cover the fundamentals, including some elements of visual perception, sensing, sampling, and quantization. Week 2- Image and Video Compression: We will learn the fundamental tools enabling us to receive images from Mars, to upload images to the web, and to store a lot of images and videos in our mobile phones. Week 3- Spatial Processing: This week we will learn some of the most classical and fundamental tools that help us still today to make noisy, blurry, and dark images look much better. Week 4- Image Restoration: When something is known or estimated about the degradation process, we can do much better, and in this week we will learn how. Week 5- Image Segmentation: How do we split an image or video in its core components? Week 6- Geometric PDEs: We will learn about the use of partial differential equations and geometric deformations for problems like image enhancement and object detection. Week 7- Image and Video Inpainting: How to make objects disappear and other special effects. Week 8- Sparse Modeling and Compressed Sensing: We will cover some of the most modern tools for image enhancement and image analysis. Week 9- Medical Imaging: As an example of medical image analysis, we will illustrate examples and techniques in the areas of brain research and virus analysis.Computer Exercises- See below for more details on this. What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends’ faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms. The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms." ,"Coursera"	"en"

(API) to graphics systems for
both education and industry. Recent advances in hardware and software have focussed application
development on the Web and for mobile devices such as smart phones. Over the past year there
has been enormous interest in WebGL, the version of OpenGL that runs within Web browsers and even
on newer smart phones. Consequently, for the first time both students and practitioners can
develop exciting three-dimensional interactive applications that are
independent of the particular
platform and can be accessed like any other Web application.



In this course, we
will learn how to create three-dimensional, interactive applications using
WebGL that run within the
latest web browsers. By the end of the course, every student will have written
and tested a complete
interactive three-dimensional application. Because WebGL is the JavaScript implementation of
OpenGL ES 2.0, all code will be developed in JavaScript. No prior knowledge of JavaScript is
required as long as participants can program in C++, C# or Java. The content of the
course will be based on the instructor's recent textbook (not required) and
course which is the first
university course to use WebGL as the API. Applications of computer graphics are ubiquitous, ranging from animations in movies to computer aided design of mechanical parts. In this course, we will learn how to create three-dimensional  interactive applications using WebGL that run within the latest web browsers. We will disucss all aspects of computer graphics from hardware to software to applications." ,"Coursera"	"en"

FAQ

Do I need to buy a textbook?

The notes, videos and exercises are all sufficient to complete this course. The textbook is optional. Included in the course are several key chapters from the book "Silicon Photonics Design", by Lukas Chrostowski and Michael Hochberg, published by Cambridge University Press. The full version (ebook or hardcopy) is available for purchase at www.cambridge.org/9781107085459.

What are the fabrication details? 

Your devices will be fabricated on a Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer with 220 nm silicon thickness, with a minimum isolated feature size of 60 nm. Each participant is allocated 410 µm x 605 µm of space, enough for >10 devices each (more available on request). One chip is being manufactured and measured for this course, and the measurement data will be provided to the course participants. 

Who will be doing the fabrication and measurements?

The fabrication will be performed by Richard Bojko, at the University of Washington, Nanofabrication Facility. The measurements will be performed by the team of Lukas Chrostowski, at The University of British Columbia.

Will I be getting a physical chip in the mail?

No. Only one chip is being manufactured for this course, and the measurements will be performed at UBC. The measurement data will be provided to the course participants.

Are there opportunities for fabrication beyond this course, including getting chips in the mail?

Yes. Either after, or during the course, you can purchase an entire chip. It will be sent to you directly. Optionally we can perform automated testing for you prior to sending it out. We typically do fabrication runs every two months. Additional options obtaining your own chips (EBeam or MPW foundries) will be discussed in the course.

Do you have any advanced silicon photonics courses, and what can I take after Phot1x?

Yes. We offer advanced courses on silicon photonics, including on-site hands-on workshops on Passive silicon photonics (ring resonators, grating couplers, Bragg gratings, etc); Active silicon photonics (modulators, detectors); CMOS electronics for photonics; and Systems, Integration and Packaging. All these workshops include fabrication via MPW foundries. More details can be found at http://siepic.ubc.ca. Phot1X is a good background course for the above workshops.

"Text Retrieval and Search Engines"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence, Information, Tech & Design, Statistics and Data Analysis This course will be covering the following topics:

Introduction to text data mining
Basic concepts in text retrieval
Information retrieval models
Implementation of a search engine
Evaluation of search engines
Advanced search engine technologies Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets. Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about people’s opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. 

This course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines. Search engines are essential tools for managing and mining big text data. Learn
how search engines work, the major search algorithms, and how to optimize search accuracy." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Week Seven: Lazy Evaluation This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that’s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today’s and tomorrow’s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions.  Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout.  In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.  The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.

 systems have changed the way people find products, information, and even 
other people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will 
prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The 
technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years
 into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or 
researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most 
important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how 
to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.The
 algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user 
collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality 
reduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach 
will be hands-on, with six two week projects, each of which will involve
 implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender.In addition to topical lectures, this course includes interviews and 
guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry.Two Ways to Take this Course:This course is designed to support two different types of students and educational goals:Programming Track: &nbsp;Designed
 for students with significant programming and mathematics experience 
(see below), the programming track combines a conceptual and 
mathematical understanding of recommender systems with experience 
programming six different recommender systems projects. &nbsp;Students 
completing this travel will gain the skills needed to implement basic 
recommenders from scratch, and to use software libraries and tools to 
implement more advanced recommenders.Concepts Track:
 &nbsp;Students who are not experienced programmers, or who are primarily 
interested in understanding the concepts and techniques of recommender 
systems, without learning to program them, can choose to focus on the 
conceptual and mathematical content, skipping the programming projects 
and associated lecture content.&nbsp; Students in the concepts track are 
still expected to have significant familiarity with computing systems 
and college-level mathematics, but need not be accomplished programmers.
 &nbsp;We expect this track to be useful for tech-savvy marketing and 
business leaders, as well as engineering managers who may oversee but 
not directly develop recommender systems. &nbsp;We also hope it will be 
useful to those looking to understand recommender systems concepts 
without the workload associated with programming those systems.&nbsp;  This course introduces the concepts, applications, algorithms, programming, and design of recommender systems--software systems that recommend products or information, often based on extensive personalization.

In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information.
 
Overall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.
 
This course was originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and the accompanying text was subsequently published by World Scientific. I am preparing a second edition for publication in 2015, which will be used for this course. The manuscript will be made available to registered students.

"Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets"	"Engineering A flow is called hypersonic if the Mach number is greater than 5. This means that the flow speed is more than five times the speed of sound. In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is around 340 m/s, so a Mach 5 flow would have a flow speed of 1.7 km/s or just over 6,000 km/h. When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit, when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet), hypersonic flows are encountered. Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets introduces the basic concepts associated with flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and takes students to the stage where they can analyse the performance of a scramjet engine that might be used in a future access-to-space system. When compressible flow occurs, how it behaves and when a flow becomes hypersonic

"Introduction to Starting Your Own Fashion Label"	"I'm the founder and designer of Lower East Side-based Assembly New York. I launched my menswear line in 2009 and presented my first womenswear collection at Milk Studios for NYFW in 2012. As a self-taught designer, everything I know about starting and running my own fashion label I learned by doing. Hindsight is 20/20 and in this class I'm going to teach you the fundamentals I wish I had access to earlier.

What You'll Learn
One of the most crucial lessons I learned over the past 5 years is that knowing what you're talking about - whether to potential partners, buyers, investors - makes all the difference in your success. Here are the fundamentals we'll cover:
Establishing Your Niche Market. Most small startups cannot even finance an entire collection, deciding what categories or articles you will focus on will offer legible and fiscally realistic goals. Staring out with a wide net  is a plan for difficult challenges, everything you may “catch” is a new, unplanned for, moving part you are now accountable for. Best to start with spearfishing and select your targets
Articulating Your Designer Mission. Independent designers are required to learn the language of their business and current marketplace attitude to effectively communicate their goals and needs relevantly
Developing Key Relationships. Labels live and die by their relationships with suppliers (fabric and trim providers) and producers (sewers) - how to successfully develop and maintain these relationships. 
Production Management. Understanding the production cycle and the key relationships necessary to produce your garments is foundational and often misunderstood/fantasized. 
Designing Sales + Marketing Strategies. How to get people to know about you and your product. Do you need a show room? A press show room? Tradeshow access? 
Building In-House Sales Processes. How to navigate the logistics of receiving, producing and shipping orders - surprisingly crucial skills for not losing money on your orders!
Securing Investment. What to consider when you don't have the luxury of someone else's cash. 

What You'll Do
In this class you'll be able to start the process of launching your label with some foundational first steps: establishing your niche market and articulating your designer mission. You'll have the opportunity to share your work for feedback from fellow classmates all over the world. " ,"coursetalk"	"en"	
"Forensic Accounting and Fraud Examination"	"Statistics and Data Analysis Week One: The Accidental Fraudster.Week Two: The Predator Fraudster.Week Three: Big Data, Benford's Law and Financial Analytics.Week Four: Cyber-Crime and Money Laundering: Contemporary Tools and Techniques.Week Five: Financial Statement Fraud and Whistle-Blowing. Fraud
is prevalent around the world, having a significant impact on the global
economy. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) 2014 Report to the
Nations projects that in 2013, worldwide fraud approached $3.7 trillion, or as
much as 5% of the productive economy.

Understanding and combating fraud, nefarious financial activities associated
with organized crime and terrorist financing is a multidimensional task. Some
fraudsters are characterized as good persons making a bad decision that appear
out of character for the individual. At the same time, there are fraud schemes
and criminal organizations established solely for the purpose of defrauding
their victims to accumulate massive amounts of cash and other assets through
activities like systematic credit card and healthcare fraud. In this course, you will develop the skills to
identify accidental versus predator fraudsters. 

Next the course introduces the topics of evidence, data
analysis and investigations; During this
stage, the course discusses cutting edge data mining, big data analysis tools,
the examination of evidence and an overview of investigation techniques
centered on putting fraud examination and forensic accounting cases together.

From there the course examines more sophisticated approaches
to concealment, money laundering, in the hopes of turning ill-gotten gains into
money and other assets seemingly derived from legitimate sources.&nbsp; Money laundering is featured as both a
concealment technique as well and a devise for clearing tainted assets.

Finally, the course considers the important role of
whistle-blowing in the anti-fraud arsenal.&nbsp;
The most common way in which frauds are discovered is by “tips.” Tips are the information provided by whistle-blowers. As such, effective
anti-fraud measures need to provide whistle-blowing options to detect frauds at
the earliest time in order to minimize damage.

These topics are delivered over five weeks. Our primary teaching tool will be the case
method. Through anecdotes sprinkled in
course lectures as well as videos of actual fraudsters in action, this courses
is hands-on, immersing participants in actual frauds perpetrated by bad guys,
providing relevant, real world knowledge, tools and skills to develop a deeper
understanding of forensic accounting and fraud examination. Everyday across the world, thousands of businesses are victimized by fraud.  Who commits these bad acts?  Why? And, how? In this course we are going to help you answer the questions: who commits fraud, why and how.  We’ll also help you develop skills for catching them." ,"Coursera"	"en"

WEEK TWO: User Needs
WEEK THREE: Decomposition of User Needs
WEEK FOUR: Concept Selection
WEEK FIVE: Concept Testing
WEEK SIX: Aesthetics in Design
WEEK SEVEN: Brands&nbsp;
WEEK EIGHT: Introduction to Supply Chain and Costing This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries theory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance. Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity.
Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis
of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior
sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also
be a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.

Student Testimonials from Earlier Sessions of the Course:

"An amazing course - a joy to take. I will really miss checking in every
    week to see the latest. I learned a great deal, from the videos, [the course staff] and my fellow
    students. I think getting the feedback from my peers was such a great way
    to run the course. So many ideas, suggestions, thoughts and words of encouragement
    that were so appreciated. I've been driving everyone I know talking about it all the time." &nbsp;--E. Wadsworth-Jones

"When I signed up for this course I didn't know what to expect; the experience
was so good and rewarding. I just loved it every step of the way. The course
was brilliant, challenging and fun! Our professor, Prof. Karl Ulrich, is
an amazing teacher, I loved his down to Earth approach.  Participating in a tournament was also one of the course's highlights. The whole thing was a great, unforgettable experience. I wish to thank with all my heart Coursera and the University of Pennsylvania for the opportunity given
to us."

Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.
In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems. In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"World War 1: Aviation Comes of Age"	"Investigate how the early days of aviation gripped the imagination of the general public, galvanised industry and excited far-sighted members of the military, with this free online course from the University of Birmingham’s Centre for War Studies.

Aviation evolved rapidly during WW1, with modern and more effective aircraft soon replacing the very basic machines that took to the skies in 1914.

We’ll look at the innovations that turned the aeroplane into a machine of war and how British factories developed to supply the Western Front with aircraft and ammunition. We’ll examine how the aeroplane became commercially viable, with passenger and mail routes starting to appear, and how the government tried - and failed - to regulate the aviation industry.

You’ll learn with Dr Peter Gray, a former commander of 101 Squadron and Director of Defence Studies for the RAF, who now teaches Birmingham’s MA in Air Power - one of several postgraduate courses the university offers in military history and World War 1 studies.

Produced in collaboration with the BBC and filmed at the Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon, this course draws on an array of first-hand interviews and archive material.

You can find out more in Peter’s posts on our blog - one looking at the first flights of World War 1, the other commemorating the Battle of Britain.

This course is part of a series designed in partnership with the BBC to commemorate the war.

"How the Internet of Things and Smart Services Will Change Society"	"The Internet of Things will forever change our personal and professional
lives. By 2020, there will be 50 billion connected devices communicating
through the Internet. Devices can range from connected coffee makers, cars, or
sensors on cattle to connected machines in a production plant. These devices
provide data that offers new insights, and as they talk to each other, they
develop their own intelligence and can advise customers about optimal ways to
put them to use. This will revolutionize consumer habits and the way we do
business.

For this openSAP course, we have invited two of the leading experts in the
field, Henning Kagermann and Bernd Leukert. They will share their views on the
Internet of Things, how it will change society and transform businesses, as
well as discuss which enabling technologies are instrumental for making use of
the Internet of Things, and the challenges and opportunities that lie before
us.

This course is aimed at anyone interested in learning about the Internet of
Things. You don’t need to have any technical knowledge as everything is
explained easily and informally.

After completing the course, you will be able to explain key terms and trends
around the Internet of Things. You will have an understanding of the potential
and value of the Internet of Things and Smart Services, and you will
understand the opportunities and benefits for society, companies, and
consumers.

"Electronic Interfaces: Bridging the Physical and Digital Worlds"	"Electronics EE40LX teaches the fundamentals of engineering electronic interfaces between the physical world and digital devices. Students can expect to cover the material of a traditional first circuits course with a project-based approach. We start with essential theory and develop an understanding of the building blocks of electronics as we analyze, design, and build different parts of a robot from scratch around a microcontroller. This course uses the Texas Instruments MSP430G2 LaunchPad, but you are welcome to bring whichever development board or microcontroller you like!

Useful mathematics will be discussed where appropriate, but only a working knowledge of high school algebra is required to follow along for most of the course. The philosophy of the course is to learn by doing, so every lecture features a substantial lab component. Students are invited to work together in small groups to build their own robots along with the instructors. There will also be individual circuit analysis and design exercises to reinforce the theories presented in the course. Those who successfully complete each theory assignment and earn a passing grade will get an Honor Code certificate from BerkeleyX.

Additionally, a kit of electronic components will be available from Newark element14 starting June 12. The kit is not necessary to obtain a certificate for this run of the course, but it will greatly enhance your learning experience. Some mechanical components are required to complete the robot as presented in the course. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter.

Creativity is encouraged! Students who are willing to work outside the bounds of the class to develop their own inventions will get the most out of this guided learning experience.

MyDAQ Information
Those who do not have access to an oscilloscope or a digital multimeter might consider purchasing a MyDAQ to enable measurements. The video modules use the MyDAQ and the MyProtoBoard as measurement equipment to debug circuits. National Instruments has made available the MyDAQ for students in this course. If you are interested, take a look at the MyDAQ ordering page: http://www.studica.com/us/en/BerkeleyMOOC.htmlParts Kit Information
The parts included in the construction of the robot can be purchased at Newark's landing page, which can be found here: http://www.element14.com/community/community/learning-center/online-learning/moocs/edxucb-bridging
A detailed bill of materials with more information can be found here: courses.edx.org/asset-v1:BerkeleyX+EE40LX+2T2015+type@asset+block@EE40LX_PartsList_Summer15.pdf

What is the format of the class?
The class consists of eight modules. Every module consists of a combination of theory-based lectures and lab-based discussions where we apply that module’s theory to building a part of a robot. Quiz exercises are sprinkled throughout the videos to reinforce your knowledge and every module ends with a problem set that reinforces the design and analysis aspects of the class.

Is this class taught at UC Berkeley?
This class is part of the laboratory component of "EE40: Introduction to Microelectronic Systems," the first circuit analysis course at UC Berkeley. It was specifically designed for the online course format.

What will the robot do?
The bare-bones robot that we build will be capable of bouncing around, responding to light or touch inputs, and responding to a loud audio signal.

What supplies and equipment will I need to get the most out of this course?
In order to download programs to the MSP430 microcontroller, you will need access to a modern operating system (Apple, Windows, or Linux) with the Energia environment (http://energia.nu/download) installed. Additionally, access to some wire cutters and pliers would be useful. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter. An oscilloscope would be useful, but not necessary.

The NI MyDAQ has been made available for students who would like to follow along with the course. The robot project as presented also requires a few wooden craft sticks and two springs which can be found at a local hardware store.

How much does the kit cost?
The parts kit will cost around $50 USD for most parts. You are welcome to purchase a kit with another student and to work together on labs to split costs. We will also demonstrate other parts not in the kit for those interested in extending their projects.

Will I need to know how to program?
Sample programs are provided in each module that will allow you to test your own circuits with an MSP430 LaunchPad controller. These programs will be explained in optional videos for interested students. If you already know how to code, you can tweak these programs to add additional functionality to your project.

Will this course cover microcontroller programming?
No. Sample programs written in Energia, a high-level language, will be provided, but programming will not be explicitly covered. Students interested in learning microcontroller programming should refer to UT Austinx’s Embedded Systems course.

What if I already have a microcontroller?
Since analog electronics are the emphasis of the course, you should feel free to use any microcontroller you feel comfortable with. However, the use of any other microcontrollers would require you to write your own programs.

Is there a required textbook?
No textbook is required for this course. Handouts are provided for the concepts presented in the class; material for some of these handouts is taken from the 2nd edition of the book Circuits by Fawwaz Ulaby and Michel Maharbiz and we recommend the book as way to delve deeper into basic circuit concepts. We also occasionally provide links to web content that we find useful or informative.

"Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots"	"Computer Science In recent years, flying robots such as miniature helicopters or quadrotors have received a large gain in popularity. Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection of industrial sites to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. 

In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors. The following topics will be covered:

3D geometry,
	probabilistic state estimation,
	visual odometry, SLAM, 3D mapping,
	linear control.
In particular, you will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory.

The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. For the flight experiments, we provide a browser-based quadrotor simulator which requires the students to write small code snippets in Python.

This course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. This course has been offered by TUM for the first time in summer term 2014 on EdX with more than 20.000 registered students of which 1400 passed examination. The MOOC is based on the previous TUM lecture “Visual Navigation for Flying Robots” which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013.

You’ll learn how to develop a product people really need by uncovering these
needs well in advance. Before you write one line of code, before you hire a
large team, before you take a big risk. You’ll learn the ins and outs of
learning if people need your product by implementing three activities to learn
from your future customers - Experience Sampling, Field Observation, and
Interviewing. After making sense of it all, you’ll be able to kick-start your

three different languages, learn the key issues in designing and using
programming languages, such as modularity and the complementary benefits
of static and dynamic typing. This course is neither particularly theoretical
nor just about programming specifics – it will give you a framework for
understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design
correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you learn to
think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language.
The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to
write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs – in any language.

"Sustainability in Practice"	"Information, Tech & Design Week 1:
CONNECTIONS&nbsp; What is sustainability? Links between sustainability and earlier ideas. Who does it, why, and how? Examples of how sustainability is used as by governments and enterprises. What is a system? Illustrations of parts, linkages, feedbacks,
    and leverage points.&nbsp;What is design thinking? &nbsp;&nbsp;
    


Week 2:
ACCOUNTING What is an efficient allocation of resources? What are the consequences of mis-allocating resources? Examples of externalities, commons problems, and cognitive bias. Discussion of lifecycle costs, behavioral influence, and aligning incentives.
Week 3:
RESILIENCE What is the relationship between mitigation of and adaptation to challenges to sustainability? What makes a system more and less resilient? How are people making cities and companies and landscapes more resilient in the face of challenges
    such as sea-level rise or energy scarcity or food security?&nbsp;&nbsp;


Week 4:
EMERGENCE Resource efficiency and system integrity seek to balance flows over time. What is emergence? How does design thinking generate productive emergence and what strategies exist for anticipating and responding to emergent threats?
    


Week 5:
JURISDICTION Who decides when resources have been accounted for, if a system is resilient enough, or whether an emerging trend is a threat or opportunity? At what scale and over what questions will such decisions be made?
    


Week 6:
PERFORMANCE Even once sustainable outcomes are legitimized into goals and decided on through commitments, how are these outcomes achieved? How would we know? Discussion of competitions and incentives, measurement and management, and new methods of
    regulating performance and compliance.
    


Week 7:
DISRUPTION How are existing roles and professions being disrupted by the demands of sustainability? Discussion of big data, simplifying system complexity, and the adaptation of legacy assets to new purposes.
    


Week 8:
CONNECTIONS Summary of discussions and of emerging questions. Evaluate the claim that sustainability in practice is about using design thinking to understand and manipulate systems. Sustainability is defining a generation of students and young professionals and their influence is transforming things like cities, companies, and laws around the world. Sustainability is often explained as meeting “the needs of the present without compromising
    the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” In practice, this means understanding connections, including connections across time. These connections create systems that are greater than the simple sums of their parts, with consequences
    that are often unexpected by people paying attention to only one part of a system. This course provides an introduction to the ideas and practices that people are using to understand and change these connections in pursuing more sustainable processes,
    communities, environments, and organizations.&nbsp;

Systems theory appears in many guises and most disciplines claim some share of the systems approach to connections and consequences. In ways that we will explore in the course, design thinking is a method for putting systems theory into practice. Designers
    and their way of thinking provide a significant contribution to sustainability in practice, from improving energy performance in buildings to identifying the value ecosystems services provide to human settlements. This course has several strategic
    partners providing us with content and with platforms for discussion. These networks will provide the course with an extensive and diverse portfolio of problems, solutions, illustrations, and challenges with which to explore the ideas presented above.
    We will use these very different venues as platforms for discussion and will organize student conversations and assignments using the network partners. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Sustainability is a practice operating across a variety of scales and skills. We will explore the ways that decision makers use systems analysis and design thinking to confront the career-defining challenges facing the next generation of  leaders.

"Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): How can PPPs help deliver better services?"	"Engineering Overview 
This overview presents the main topics the course will include: 

Week 1: Reducing the Infrastructure Service Gap: The Role of PPPs
 
This first module introduces how and why private sector expertise and resources should be considered by governments to assist in addressing the infrastructure gap.  In particular, it explains the importance of infrastructure to economic growth, the gap between the demand and existing supply for infrastructure services, and the challenges that governments have in addressing this gap. 


The module presents the PPP concept, its defining features, and the types of contractual arrangements, which reflect the extent of the private sector’s participation. Not all arrangements between a public and private party are PPPs and explanations of what is not a PPP are also provided. Examples of successful and failed cases of PPPs are introduced to illustrate conditions for PPP success and to underscore the need for sound analysis and need for sustainability, stakeholder engagement and good governance.

Week 2: Getting Decision-Making Right: PPP Frameworks and Institutions
Whether undertaking PPPs as a series of ad hoc projects or through a coordinated program, PPPs require a change of approach and mind-set to delivering services and infrastructure. What does this mean for government institutions and what approaches are needed to manage this change? 



This module examines the principles, value and challenges of putting in place a supportive framework to facilitate the execution of PPP projects with the aim of increased infrastructure investment and improved service delivery. While there is no “model” legal or organizational framework for PPPs, a clear and well-communicated articulation of the policy rationale for PPPs as well as the organization of laws, processes and institutional responsibilities that define how PPPs will be implemented are common elements that help ensure a positive private sector response.  You will be introduced to lessons learned from the execution of PPPs and how these lessons can be incorporated into successful PPP frameworks. In Week 2, an overview of the different stages of the PPP life cycle is also presented and the first stage of the PPP project cycle (project identification and screening) is explained. This overview provides the foundation for the discussions in weeks three and four, which will go into deeper into the procurement and contract management stages of the PPP project cycle.

Week 3: Attracting the Right Partner: Procuring PPPs
Being able to engage the right private sector partner starts with a well-prepared, commercially sustainable project. This module begins with a discussion about what is needed to demonstrate the “business case” to take forward a project as a PPP and the importance of structuring the PPP arrangements to ensure an appropriate risk allocation between the private sector sponsor, the financiers of the project, and the government. A well-designed and implemented transaction process is equally important, to ensure the best deal for government and to interest potential private sector partners who are able to achieve the desired efficiency and other improvements for the public users. &nbsp;However, managing a PPP transaction through to contract award is a complex and iterative process. This module walks through the stages of the tender process and explains the challenges in achieving a successful outcome. &nbsp;Finally, the module introduces the management of unsolicited proposals which, while outside a competitive tender process, may be a useful source of innovative ideas, but need to be subject to a thorough evaluation to ensure they respond to government needs efficiently.

Week 4: Making the Partnership Work: Implementing PPPs
When a PPP contract is signed with a private party, the work of the partnership begins, and both private and public parties have to live up to their responsibilities. PPP contracts attempt to identify and plan for the potential events that could occur during the life of the PPP but can rarely imagine all events into the future. Consequently, developing a strong and trustful partnership and a solid contract management approach is important to achieve the long-term objectives of the PPP. This stage spans the life of the PPP agreement beginning when the PPP contract is signed until the partnership ends. This module presents the fundamentals and challenges of contract management, enforcing the PPP contract requirements and, potentially, renegotiating or terminating contracts. 

 

Course Tracks

Participants can participate in one of two tracks:



Track 1: PPP Awareness (2 hours/week).
Track 2: Policy and Practice (3-4 hours/week).

Participants can move from the PPP Awareness track to the Policy and Practice track at any point during the course. 

We encourage participants to join the Policy and Practice track to deepen their knowledge of the subject.

Track 1 – PPP Awareness
 

Target Audience
This track is suitable for anyone with a general interest in PPPs and desire to increase their understanding about PPPs.  The course provides insight into key concepts and issues in developing, procuring and implementing PPPs. 
 
Common Objective
To understand PPPs and their role in increasing the delivery of quality infrastructure services.

Assignments

Assignments focus on facilitating an understanding of the mandatory course material that is covered in the video talks and core readings through multiple choice quizzes and one peer-reviewed opinion piece on a key topic about PPPs.

Track 2 – Policy and Practice
 

Target Audience
This track is designed for those wishing to gain greater knowledge of PPPs, and to develop networks of practice with counterparts from around the world. While this course only touches the surface of knowledge and experience about PPPs, references and next steps will be offered for those wishing to continue their learning. 
 

Common Objective 
To understand PPPs and their role in increasing the delivery of quality infrastructure services.


Assignments
In additional to multiple choice quizzes and the Track 1 assignment, this track includes a project where participants identify an infrastructure project that could be developed as a PPP and create a digital artifact that can be used as a proposal to convince the government to undertake the project. The digital artifact should clearly articulate the value of the project to the government (and for its citizens) and demonstrate how the project would have a balanced risk allocation between the government and the private sector.

The course includes video lectures, readings, quizzes and other learning materials designed and taught by experts from Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, the Indian School of Business, the European Investment Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), among other institutions.



Whether you are a member of the general public, a practitioner, or a policy maker, there is something in this course for you.
 
  Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) are one tool that governments can employ to help deliver needed infrastructure services. PPPs are a way of contracting for services, using private sector innovation and expertise, and they often leverage private finance. PPPs can, implemented under the right circumstances, improve service provision and facilitate economic growth." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Powerful Tools for Teaching and Learning: Web 2.0 Tools"	"Information, Tech & Design Our Web 2.0 explorations during Weeks One, Two and Three are based on ideas in the article, Implementing the Seven Principles: Technology as Lever by Arthur Chickering and Stephen C. Ehrmann.

Week One: Can you hear me now? Exploring Web 2.0 Tools for Communication.In Week One, we will explore the first of the seven principles, "Good Practice Encourages Contacts Between Students and Faculty." Communicating effectively through words and writing in diverse environments using technology is one of the most important aspects of learning and growth in education. Every one of us has faced some type of
communication problems in class and may have struggled sometimes to tackle them
effectively in this digital age. Consider this question: What is a communication issue in your teaching environment that could be resolved by using new technologies?

Week Two: Do we have to do group work? Exploring Web 2.0 Tools for CollaborationIn Week Two, we will consider the second principle, "Good Practice Develops Reciprocity and Cooperation Among Students." Working together in a group is always a challenge. To effectively collaborate with peers in a diverse team using technology is one of the most important aspects of learning and growth in education. Every one of us has faced some type of collaboration problems in class and may have struggled
sometimes to tackle them effectively in this digital age. Consider this question: What is a collaboration issue in your teaching environment that could be resolved by using new technologies?

Week  Three: Another PowerPoint? Exploring Web 2.0 Tools for CreativityIn Week Three, we will look at another principle, "Good Practice Respects Diverse Talents and Ways of Learning." Being creative is not just about creating new ideas; it is also about techniques that will help to develop, nurture and evaluate worthwhile ideas. Encouraging and inculcating creative techniques in teaching is one of the most critical aspects of learning and growth in education especially in this digital age. Consider this question: What is a creativity issue in your teaching environment that could be resolved by using new technologies?

Week Four:&nbsp;Oh! So That’s How It Fits Together,&nbsp;Utilizing My Toolbox.
In Week Four, you will apply what you have learned in a mini action research project in your classroom. Using Web 2.0 tools is not about the technology but about improving student learning. In this module, we will highlight the connections between the things you have learned and the various instructional technology standards for 21st century learners and educators. Consider this question: What are the student outcomes in each of these tool categories? In other words, what skill set do we want our students to have as they use instructional technology in accomplishing their learning objectives?&nbsp;

Week Five: It does not end here! Lifelong Learning
In Week Five,&nbsp;we will wrap things up with ways you can keep adding tools to your Web 2.0 toolbox. &nbsp;We will also share ideas on developing personal learning networks (PLNs) to support lifelong learning. Finally, you will finish the course with a great set of Web 2.0 tool resources to further explore and learn. Are you overwhelmed by the tidal wave of new technology tools available for teachers and learners? Powerful Tools for Teaching and Learning: Web 2.0 Tools can help channel that flood into a manageable power source for student engagement and motivation in your classroom! This course is designed to provide teachers with strategies to effectively integrate Web 2.0 technologies into their instruction. You will learn how to use these tools effectively in your classroom
through unique problem-based scenarios that will help you understand how to
choose the best Web 2.0 tool. Our approach focuses on the task rather than the tool in an effort to improve communication,
collaboration, presentation, creativity, problem solving, and critical thinking in your learners. You will take part in a robust exchange of practical ideas while participating in online discussion
forums and sharing your experiences and learning from fellow teachers about best practices with Web 2.0 tools in your content area.

is a course about the fundamentals of the online/digital world.&nbsp; It’s aim to provide a set of concepts and
tools with which to view online developments.&nbsp;
These concepts are the language and the vocabulary which can explain and
also predict how technology impacts different industries.The
course is not an overview of EC or IT developments but rather ways in which we
can make sense of EC and IT developments.&nbsp;
Thus, the emphasis is not on the “what” but on the “why.”In
the first 5 weeks, different concepts and their significance are explained. &nbsp;The role of these concepts in explaining the
success of dominant, marquee companies is also discussed.





In
the 6th and final week, participants observe how these concepts apply
to different contexts.&nbsp; These contexts
are case studies of multiple companies. Actual class discussions are shown to
illustrate how the concepts can be used to understand and predict IT-driven
transformations. The aim of this course is to understand issues that companies need to address when moving from being offline to online and learn how companies can craft business models where IT is embedded as an integral part of products, processes and customer interactions.

"Philosophy and the Sciences"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence Week 1.&nbsp;Introduction to the course
    

(Michela Massimi and Duncan Pritchard)In this Introductory session, we introduce you to the broad field of 'philosophy of science' and clarify some of the central questions that philosophers ask about science. In particular, we briefly review the nature of scientific knowledge and debates about the scientific method, from induction to Karl Popper's falsification. We also discuss the problem of underdetermination, and Thomas Kuhn's view of scientific knowledge—both central to our following lectures on philosophy of cosmology.
PART I. PHILOSOPHY AND THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES


Week 2. The origin of our universe 

(Michela Massimi and John Peacock)

How did our universe form and
evolve? Was there really a Big Bang,
and what came before it? In this class, we take you through the history of
contemporary cosmology and we look at how scientists arrived at the current
understanding of our universe. We look at the history of astronomy, with the
nebular hypothesis back in the eighteenth century, and in more recent times,
Einstein’s general relativity and the ensuing cosmological models. Finally, we
explain the current Standard Model and early universe cosmology and the
experimental evidence behind it. &nbsp;


Week 3. What are dark matter and dark energy? 

(Michela Massimi and John
Peacock) 

According to the currently accepted model in cosmology, our universe is made up of 5% of ordinary matter, 25% cold dark matter, and 70% dark energy. But what kind of entities are dark matter and dark energy? In this class, we take you through a fascinating
    journey at the frontiers of contemporary cosmology and particle physics. We also look at alternative theories that explain the same experimental evidence without recourse to the hypothesis of dark matter and dark energy and we discuss the rationale
    for choosing between rival research programs.&nbsp;


Week 4. The Anthropic Reasoning in Philosophy and Cosmology 

(Alasdair Richmond
and John Peacock) 


Anthropic reasoning attempts to understand peculiarities of the physical universe via context-sensitive observers in a multiverse of different distinct universes. Anthropic reasoning can explain the dimensionality of space (and time), the ratio of gravitational
    and electromagnetic forces, the valency of carbon bonds, and the ages of the stars we observe in the night sky. Other anthropic explanations suggest that our universe ought to be a gigantic time machine and that we may live inside a ‘Matrix’-style
    computer-simulated reality. In this class, we review the problems and prospects of anthropic reasoning by drawing on cutting-edge research in galaxy formation.


    


PART II. PHILOSOPHY AND THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES

Week 5. Stone-age minds in modern skulls:
evolutionary theory and the philosophy of mind 

(Suilin Lavelle and Kenny Smith)


This week, we will explore scientific interpretations of how our minds evolved, and some of the methodologies used in forming these interpretations. &nbsp;We will relate evolutionary debates to a core issue in the philosophy of mind, namely, whether all
    knowledge comes from experience, or whether we have ‘inborn’ knowledge about certain aspects of our world.
Week 6. What is consciousness? 

(Mark Sprevak and David Carmel)

One of the hardest problems in
science is the nature of consciousness. We know that we have consciousness. We
do not just blindly process information, make discriminations, take actions. It
also feels a certain way to do so
from the inside. Why do creatures with brains like ours have consciousness?
What makes certain bits of our mental life conscious and others not? These
questions form the heart of consciousness
science, an exciting field to which psychologists, neuroscientists and
philosophers contribute. This session will explore these questions, and
introduce some recent progress that has been made towards answering them.

Week 7. Intelligent machines and the human brain 

(Mark Sprevak and Peggy Series)

How does one make a clever
adaptive machine that can recognise speech, control an aircraft, and detect
credit card fraud? Recent years have seen a revolution in the kinds of tasks
computers can do. Underlying these advances is the burgeoning
field of machine learning and
computational neuroscience. The same methods that allow us to make clever
machines also appear to hold the key to understanding ourselves: to explaining
how our brain and mind work. We explore this exciting new field and some of the
philosophical questions that it raises.

Week 8. Embodied
Cognition 

(Andy Clark and Barbara Webb) 

Cognitive Science has recently
taken a strongly 'embodied turn', recognizing that biologically evolved
intelligence makes the most of the opportunities provided by bodily form,
action, and the material and social environment. This session explores the way
this impacts our vision of minds, brains, and intelligent agents, and asks
whether there can be&nbsp;a fundamental science of the embodied mind. What is the origin of our universe? What are dark matter and dark energy? What is our role in the universe as human agents capable of knowledge? What makes us intelligent cognitive agents seemingly endowed with consciousness? 

Scientific research across both the physical sciences and the cognitive sciences has raised pressing questions for philosophers. The goal of this course is to introduce you to some of the main areas and topics at the key juncture between philosophy and
    the sciences. The course is structured around two broad areas:&nbsp;




    Philosophy and the Physical Sciences
    Philosophy and the Cognitive Sciences
        
        
    

Each week we will introduce you to some of these important questions at the forefront of scientific research. We will explain the science behind each topic in a simple, non-technical way, while also addressing the philosophical and conceptual questions
    arising from it. Areas you’ll learn about will include:


    
        Philosophy of cosmology, where we’ll consider questions about the origin and evolution of our universe, the nature of dark energy and dark matter and the role of anthropic reasoning in the explanation of our universe.


    Philosophy of psychology, among whose issues we will cover the evolution of the human mind and the nature of consciousness.


    Philosophy of neurosciences, where we’ll consider the nature of human cognition and the relation between mind, machines, and the environment.
        
          
    

  
Learning Objectives

    Gain a fairly well-rounded view on selected areas and topics at the intersection of philosophy and the sciences


    Understand some key questions, and conceptual problems arising in the natural sciences and cognitive sciences.


    Develop critical skills to evaluate and assess these problems.
    

The development of this MOOC has been led by the University of Edinburgh's Eidyn research centre.

"Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python"	"Computer Science This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses.

Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

"Compilers"	"Computer Science: Software Engineering, Computer Science: Systems & Security This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.
The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.
An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.I hope you enjoy the course!
Why Study Compilers?
Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.

"Common Core in Action: Math Classroom Challenges- Using Formative Assessment to Guide Instruction"	"Mathematics In this course, you will gain access to the MAP’s website, and choose from among 60 Classroom Challenges to teach, in order to effectively use formative assessment to move student thinking forward while enhancing your own teaching practice. In the first section, you will consider content you will soon be teaching, then select and explore a Classroom Challenge that aligns with that content. You will give an initial assessment in order to measure and better-understand students’ current understanding of the content, as well as uncover gaps and misconceptions. In the second section, you will analyze the results of the initial assessment, note assets, gaps, and misconceptions, and then use the provided resources in the Classroom Challenge to teach your students through collaborative and whole-group activities – culminating with a re-assessment of students’ understanding.  In the final section, you will compare the initial and post assessment data, and discuss how using the Classroom Challenge in your class enhanced student understanding as well as your own teaching practice. The Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) offer the opportunity for educators to transform teaching and learning by positioning students in more active roles as learners. In addition to explicit content standards (which describe what students will know), the CCSSM present a broad range of practice standards that describe ways that successful students in math demonstrate proficiency. What do students and teachers need to know to take on these standards? What does it mean, for example, for students to persevere through new and challenging problems, and/or critique the reasoning of other students, and how can their teachers best support them?In the words of one math teacher, “it’s not the students’ job to figure out what is in our heads; it’s the teacher’s job to figure out what is in theirs.” Such an approach requires far more focus on formative assessment and deliberate strategies for teachers to pre-assess students’ assets, needs, and misconceptions – then move them forward while continually re-assessing.  This course offers participants an opportunity to engage in a community of learners using an inquiry cycle focusing on math formative assessments as a strategy for implementing CCSS in math. It focuses on the implementation of a Classroom Challenge: a 1 – 2 day lesson developed by the Mathematics Assessment Project (MAP) based on formative assessment and the CCSSM." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Computing: Art, Magic, Science"	"Computer Science Information Technology (IT) is everywhere. Every aspect of human activity depends on it. All IT processes, whether they drive mobile phones, the Internet, transportation systems, enterprise systems, publishing, social networks or any other application, rely on software.

In this new and improved version of the course, you will learn to write software with a progressive hint system for first time programmers. The core skill is programming; not just the ability to piece together a few “lines of code,” but writing quality programs, which will do their job right, and meet the evolving needs of their users. Anyone can write a program; this course teaches you to write good programs.

The course starts from the basics of computing and takes you through a tour of modern object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, control structures, inheritance, polymorphism, and genericity.

Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to learn the principles of programming as well as the techniques for designing correct and reliable programs by using the Eiffel programming language and notation. You will be trying out example problems to provide your solution, and see it immediately compiled and tested from within your browser. To this end, we are using the Codeboard;web-based IDE, developed at the Chair of Software Engineering (ETH Zurich). 

Beyond programming, you will also get a glimpse at theoretical computer science, the set of mathematical techniques that underlie computation and makes today’s IT-based world possible.

In this third edition of the course we specifically focus on helping students with little or no programming experience. To this end, we have improved the introductory material about the Eiffel language, and we have implemented a progressive hint system students can use to get guidance on how to solve the programming exercises.

"Really good course. Followed it with a couple of experienced colleagues all of them having a computer science background. They really liked the concepts and programming in Eiffel a lot. Many thanks to the team making this course available! Can not wait to start with the advanced course!" --Previous CAMSx Participant

"Computational Molecular Evolution"	"Statistics and Data Analysis Module 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to evolutionary theory and&nbsp;population genetics: models of growth, selection and mutationModule&nbsp;2:&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutral mutations and genetic drift. Tree reconstruction by parsimonyModule&nbsp;3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consensus trees. Distance matrix methodsModule&nbsp;4: &nbsp;&nbsp;Models of sequence evolution. Likelihood methodsModule&nbsp;5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayesian inference of phylogenyModule&nbsp;6: &nbsp;&nbsp;Testing hypotheses in a phylogenetic context This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem. A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (e.g., neighbor joining). Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are  investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree will be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer. Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).Topics covered:Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.Mechanisms of molecular evolution.Models of substitution.Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian statistics). In this course you will learn about how and why DNA and protein sequences evolve. You will learn the theory behind methods for building and analyzing phylogenetic trees, and get hands-on experience with some widely used software packages." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Data Mining Capstone"	"Computer Science: Software Engineering, Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence, Information, Tech & Design, Statistics and Data Analysis The Capstone project will include several peer graded tasks and a final report. This six-week long Capstone course of the Data Mining Specialization will allow you to apply the learned algorithms and techniques for data mining from the previous courses in the Specialization, including Pattern Discovery, Clustering, Text Retrieval, Text Mining, and Visualization, to solve interesting real-world data mining challenges. Specifically, you will work on a restaurant review data set from Yelp and use all the knowledge and skills you’ve learned from the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge. The design of the Capstone emphasizes: 1) simulating the workflow of a data miner in a real job setting; 2) integrating different mining techniques covered in multiple individual courses; 3) experimenting with different ways to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques; and 4) allowing you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively. 

The goal of the Capstone project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. The project will include the following outputs: 

Opinion visualization: explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.
Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities.
Discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes of a particular cuisine.
Recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.


From the perspective of users, a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they decide what cuisine to try, they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally, they will need to choose a restaurant. Thus, recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful. Moreover, predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant would also be helpful. 

By working on these tasks, you will gain experience with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing, data exploration, data analysis, improvement of analysis methods, and presentation of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve it. We will suggest specific approaches, but you are highly encouraged to explore your own ideas since open exploration is, by design, a goal of the Capstone. 

You are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks for peer grading. A final consolidated report is also required, which will be peer-graded, and the top 20 reports, as evaluated by peer review, will also be judged by an Industry Expert Committee who will select 10 of the reports as the Best Capstone Projects. The Industry Expert Committee is composed of multiple relevant industry experts representing different companies. Apply the learned algorithms and techniques for data mining from the previous courses in the Data Mining Specialization to solve interesting real-world data mining challenges." ,"Coursera"	"en"	
"Introduction to Management Information Systems (MIS): A Survival Guide"	"Business & Management This MIS course will cover supporting tech infrastructures (Cloud, Databases, Big Data), the MIS development/ procurement process, and the main integrated systems, ERPs, such as SAP®, Oracle® or Microsoft Dynamics Navision®, as well as their relationship with Business Process Redesign.

Management Information Systems (MIS) are an integral part of today’s professional landscape. From customer relationship management (CRM) systems handling the daily interactions with clients and prospects, to financial systems issuing invoices and paying bills, day-to-day working life is increasingly controlled by these systems that dictate what to do and how.

This course will focus on what MIS are, how they influence your current or prospective jobs, why they impose specific - and sometimes seemingly absurd - operational procedures, and how to use this knowledge to your advantage in your professional life.

Grasping the key concepts in MIS does not need to be daunting. We will use real world examples to illustrate key concepts, and strive to strike a proper balance between clarity / amenity and conceptual soundness. Join us on this stimulating journey that will allow you to better understand and perform in your current or desired job. Understand Management Information Systems (MIS) and their role in today’s organizations.
	Identify how MIS shapes and controls current (or prospective) jobs and how to use this insight to improve your own job performance and satisfaction and and enhance your career prospects.
	Become familiar with the major trends in MIS and MIS infrastructures (Cloud, Big Data, ERPs, outsourcing) and how these evolutions will affect workplaces and business strategies.
	Bridge the MIS-related second “digital gap” that exists, after basic computer literacy, in most professional jobs." ,""	"English"

GRADING  POLICY &amp; COURSE REQUIREMENTS
Grading&nbsp;
  Assignments and projects are graded through a peer-review process;  quizzes are multiple-choice and are graded by the computer. Your work on the  assignments, projects and group presentation will be assessed two ways: your  individual work to complete the assignment, project or presentation, and your  own review of your peers’ work. Peer review counts as the participation  component of your own grade, which means for everything you hand in you will  also make substantive comments on the assignments which will be graded, and  rate others’ comments

Passing Grade = 75%
Quizzes&nbsp;
After watching each video lecture series, you  will take a multiple choice quiz which will count towards your final grade. You  can only take these quizzes once. There are also “in-video questions,” and you  must answer these questions correctly in order to advance the video, but these  questions are NOT graded, you can re-do the “in-video” quiz as many times as  you need to.
Assignments
Assignments are purely technical; each module  will include a detailed explanation of how to complete and grade each assignment.  There will be 1 assignment (which may have multiple components)&nbsp; every week that there is no project due.&nbsp; Each assignment should take you no more than  one hour.
Projects
Projects are both aesthetic and technical; there  will be an explanation of how to grade projects but you must remember that art  is subjective. There are only three projects, and together they are worth the  majority of your grade. You can expect these projects to take at&nbsp; least 3-4 hours to complete. (Final project  should take 6 hours.)
Group  Presentation
  In groups of 4-7, you will create a five-minute  presentation that the other students can view. You can use any method or  technology for loading this that works with your eportfolio site and  collaborating. There will be a list of topics to choose from on a movement in  twentieth or 21st century art or music.

PEER FEEDBACK  GRADING RUBRIC
You will grade each other’s work, and also grade each other’s comments.  There will be instructions on how to grade the assignments, projects, and  presentation, and each assignment will come with it's own grading chart (rubric) to follow.&nbsp; In this 17-week course we will introduce the fundamentals of computational arts–covering basic programming, simple image processing and elementary sound recording. This class has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing.*For programming we will be using the free and open source programming language and integrated development environment, Processing. The course will provide the essentials of programming in a visual context, allowing you to visualize, design, and create generative art with Processing.For visuals we will cover Photoshop CS5 and GIMP, which is a free open-source tool offering the same functionality as Photoshop. Whether you have access to one or the other, you will learn how to create and manipulate digital images, and most importantly, you will become comfortable enough to expand on what you learn here, after the end of our course.For sound we will teach both Logic and Soundation. Logic is Apple’s DAW or Digital Audio Workstation while Soundation is a free web-based multi-track audio editor. We’ll be teaching the basics of digital audio–including recording, and automating effects. You will complete both technical assignments and artistic projects, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. We’ll cover the history of sound and art in the Twentieth and 21st Centuries to give context for your artistic endeavors.Peer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 15 weeks you should have a strong foundation for how computers work and deal with data, specifically how image and sound are represented by the computer.Additionally, you will create an online portfolio of digital art projects, and be able to communicate ideas about art. &nbsp;Each week you will watch two video series - one on the theory and one on the practice. There will be technical assignments and artistic projects which will be peer reviewed. We’re looking forward to working with you. *If you are interested in just a part of this course, you may want to consider enrolling in the individual segments in the Spring (Intro to Computational Arts Processing, Visual Arts and Audio.) &nbsp;These courses will not include the use of eportfolio and will not have a summative capstone.&nbsp; This multidisciplinary production class serves as an introduction to, and exploration of electronic media in the arts. Lectures will cover concepts and presentations of artists working in various capacities with computers, as well as tutorials on specific software packages." ,"Coursera"	"en"

Programming with C# course is all about learning how to develop video games
using the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++, Java,
ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First,
using C# lets us use the Microsoft XNA and open-source MonoGame frameworks,
which help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS, and
others. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game
developers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity
environment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to
program.



That learning how to program
comment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming
experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the
very beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the
end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts
that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also
learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the
entities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and
simple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.



Computer programming is really fun in general,
and programming games is even better! Start learning how to program video games using the C# programming language. Plenty of practice opportunities are included!" ,"Coursera"	"en"	
"Surveillance Law"	"Computer Science: Systems & Security I. Introduction
We will begin with a brief overview of how surveillance fits into the American legal system. We will also discuss how surveillance issues can be litigated.


II. The Basics of Surveillance Law
Next, we will review established police surveillance procedures. Using telephone technology as a simple starting point, we will work through various sorts of data that investigators might seek to access—and the constitutional and statutory safeguards on that data.

III. Applying Surveillance Law to Information Technology
Having learned the basics, we will turn to more modern technologies. We will discuss snooping on email, web browsing, and mobile phone location, as well as hacking into devices.

IV. Compelled Assistance to Law Enforcement
What happens when data is technically protected? In this section, we will talk about the government’s (limited) ability to mandate backdoors and to require decryption.

V. The Structure of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Law
The law that applies to foreign intelligence activities runs parallel to the law that applies to police activities. We will compare the two systems of law and review key distinctions. The section places particular emphasis on Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, and Executive Order 12333.

VI. Controversial NSA Programs
In the final section, we will review the conduct and legality of controversial National Security Agency programs. We will discuss in detail the domestic phone metadata program, PRISM, and “upstream” Internet monitoring. It’s easy to be
cynical about government surveillance. In recent years, a parade of Orwellian
disclosures have been making headlines. The FBI, for example, is hacking into
computers that run anonymizing software. The NSA is vacuuming up domestic phone
records. Even local police departments are getting in on the act, tracking cellphone location history and intercepting signals in realtime.

Perhaps 2014 is
not quite 1984, though. This course explores how American law facilitates electronic
surveillance—but also substantially constrains it. You will learn the legal
procedures that police and intelligence agencies have at their disposal, as well as the security
and privacy safeguards built into those procedures. The material also provides
brief, not-too-geeky technical explanations of some common surveillance
methods. Learn how police and intelligence agencies can access your data, and how the law (might) protect you! Hackers, attorneys, and concerned citizens are all welcome." ,"Coursera"	"en"

FAQ

What software will be required for this course?

We will use Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK) to give the computer the capability to run java programs and use BlueJ as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing Java programs.

Which version of Java will be used in this course?

The course is based on Java Version 7. It is fine that if you would like to use Java Version 8, but the new features introduced in Version 8 will not be covered by this course.

What are the system requirements for MS Windows users?

Java Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by MS Windows XP or above (except Windows RT). Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Internet Explorer 8+ or Firefox 3.6+ or Google Chrome to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.

What are the system requirements for Mac users?

Java Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or above. Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Safari 5.1.3+ or Firefox 3.6+ (64-bit) to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Google Chrome is not supported. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.

What are the system requirements for Linux users?

Java Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Ubuntu/Debian Linux. OpenJDK, an implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK), will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Firefox 3.6+ to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.

Can I use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) other than BlueJ?

In this course, we would recommend BlueJ to beginning programmers as it is compact and provides just enough features for learning programming. Most of the programming examples in this course assume using BlueJ. However, you may use other professional IDEs such as Eclipse and NetBeans according to your own preference.

Will I be required to view Java Applets for learning the course materials?

There will be some demonstration programs shown as Java Applets in this course. However, these applets will only act as supplementary materials. Inaccessible to the applets would not affect the learning of the course materials. To access the applets, you will have to enable or activate Java plug-in on the browser. The plug-in requires 32-bit version of Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) on MS Windows, 64-bit version of JRE on Mac OS X or 32/64-bit version of OpenJDK on Linux depending on the architecture of the system. Take a “real-life” problem and abstract out&nbsp;the pertinent aspects necessary to solve it in an algorithmic manner.

The idea is to perturb different types of human cells with many different types of perturbations such as: drugs and other small molecules; genetic manipulations such as knockdown or overexpression of genes; manipulation of the extracellular microenvironment conditions, for example, growing cells on different surfaces, and more. These perturbations are applied to various types of human cells including induced pluripotent stem cells from patients, differentiated into various lineages such as neurons or cardiomyocytes. Then, to better understand the molecular networks that are affected by these perturbations, changes in level of many different variables are measured including: mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites, as well as cellular phenotypic changes such as changes in cell morphology. In most cases, this life sciences data is collected at the genome-wide scale across different regulatory layers.&nbsp;The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is commissioned to organize, analyze, visualize and integrate LINCS data with other publicly available relevant resources. In this course we will introduce the various Centers that collect data for LINCS, describing the experimental data procedures and the various data types. We will then cover the design and collection of metadata and how metadata is linked to ontologies. We will then cover basic data processing and data normalization methods to clean and harmonize LINCS data. This will follow a discussion about how the data is served as RESTful APIs and JSON, and for this we will cover concepts from client-server computing. Most importantly, the course will focus on various bioinformatics methods of analysis including: unsupervised clustering, gene-set enrichment analyses, Bayesian integration, network visualization, and supervised machine learning applications to LINCS data and other relevant Big Data from molecular biomedicine. The course will be taught by members of the Ma'ayan Lab at the Icahn School of Medicine Mount Sinai, Medvedovic Lab at the University of Cincinnati, Schurer Lab at the University of Miami, and other members of the BD2K-LINCS DCIC Team as well as members of other BD2K and LINCS NIH funded centers.

"Introduction to Logic"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, Computer Science: Theory Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history.
    It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the
    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.
This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize
    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically
    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical
    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in
    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.
The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important
    ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility
    while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive
    demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications

in small committees. Many interesting philosophical and mathematical issues arise when
we carefully examine our group decision-making processes.&nbsp;There are two types of group
decision making problems that we will discuss in this course. A voting problem: Suppose
that a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on which
restaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But, how should the friends decide where
to go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find a
choice that is “fair” taking into account everyone’s opinions or must we choose one person
from the group to act as a “dictator”? A fair division problem: Suppose that there is a cake and
a group of hungry children. Naturally, you want to cut the cake and distribute the pieces
to the children as fairly as possible. If the cake is homogeneous (e.g., a chocolate cake with
vanilla icing evenly distributed), then it is easy to find a fair division: give each child a piece
that is the same size. But, how do we find a “fair” division of the cake if it is heterogeneous
(e.g., icing that is 1/3 chocolate, 1/3 vanilla and 1/3 strawberry) and the children each want
different parts of the cake?&nbsp;

Additionally, we will be re-offering the courses more frequently. For example, new sessions of my two introductory courses will be launched on a monthly basis, so that you can find a convenient time to join us or pick up where you left off if you didn’t quite finish before.For previous MoCCA students:&nbsp;If you have already earned a Verified Certificate in the previous version of this course, "Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems” offered in May 2014, you do not need to retake this course to continue towards the Specialization certificate and final project in 2015. Please consult the&nbsp;Specializations Help Center&nbsp;or contact the&nbsp;Coursera support team&nbsp;if you are not sure whether you qualify.This MOOC and five others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera platform, structured as follows:The first two courses by Dr. Adam Porter, of the University of Maryland, are&nbsp;Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems Part 1&nbsp;and&nbsp;Part 2. They focus on the design and programming of user-facing applications. &nbsp;The third and fourth courses by Dr. Douglas Schmidt, of Vanderbilt University, are&nbsp;Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Concurrency&nbsp;and&nbsp;Communication. They focus on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services. &nbsp;The fifth and sixth courses by Dr. Jules White, of Vanderbilt University, are&nbsp;Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems: Spring&nbsp;and&nbsp;Security. &nbsp;They focus on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2.The final “capstone” project will require students to develop a complex mobile cloud computing application from the ground up.Some of the programming assignments and the iRemember integrative project for these MOOCs will be coordinated. &nbsp;If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud. In this course we will learn how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Modeling Discrete Optimization"	"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence The course has an open format. &nbsp;At the start of the course all of the assignments and lectures are available and each student is free to design their own plan of study and proceed at their own pace. &nbsp;The assessments in the course consist of five modeling tasks where students experience the challenges of solving discrete optimization problems. &nbsp;The class community is an important aspect of this course and students are encouraged to collaborate and help each other in the completion of the assignments. The world is full of hard discrete optimization problems. You have experienced them already if you have ever solved a sudoku puzzle or organized the seating at a wedding banquet. These problems underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods. 
In this course you will learn an entirely new way to think about solving these challenging discrete optimization problems by stating the problem in the high level modeling language, MiniZinc, and letting constraint solving software do the rest.  This will allow you to unlock the power of industrial solving technologies, which have been perfected over decades by hundreds of PhD researchers. &nbsp;With access to this advanced technology, problems that you could not conceive solving before will suddenly become easy and bring you one step closer to "the holy grail of programming: the user states the problem, the computer solves it."

"Paradigms of Computer Programming – Fundamentals"	"Computer Science Louv1.1x and Louv1.2x together give an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.

The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.

Louv1.1x covers fundamental concepts. You’ll learn functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You’ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.

Louv1.2x covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You’ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You’ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.

"Automata"	"Computer Science: Theory Week 1: Finite AutomataWeek 2: Regular Expressions and Properties of Regular LanguagesWeek 3: Context-Free Grammars and LanguagesWeek 4: Properties of Context-Free Languages, plus introduction to Turing MachinesWeek 5: Turing Machines and UndecidabilityWeek 6: Intractable Problems (NP-Completeness) I am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory, based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Participants have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.
The course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.Why Study Automata Theory?This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than "push this button."The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach — simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.During the course, I'm going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases. This course covers finite automata, context-free grammars, Turing machines, undecidable problems, and intractable problems (NP-completeness)." ,"Coursera"	"en"

&nbsp;
Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.
&nbsp;The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at&nbsp;first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course.Subtitles for all video lectures available in: Portuguese&nbsp;(provided by&nbsp;The Lemann Foundation), English Learn how to think the way mathematicians do - a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Certified C Coder"	"C programming is the root or foundation for any person who wants to master computer programming. Learning C in a comprehensive manner is very essential for every software interested soul, but things can only be interesting when words are not jargon and every piece of code is explained in a detailed manner, and that’s what this course is all about. Meet the most comprehensive online C programming course and C tutorials video series. This series will help you to understand basics of programming by introducing data types, constants, and variables. Further we will learn in C coding about various operations that can be performed like arithmetic operations, relational operations, logical operations and bitwise operations.After completing these basic operations, we will master intermediate topics like while loops, do while loops, and for loops along with lots of conditional operations. Further in the advance section of this online C tutorial, we will explore about functions, arrays, union, and structures in C programming language.If you have never coded before in life, then C is a great point to start from. Basics of C programming language will help you to jump into lots of other languages, like c plus plus, python, ruby, or php. Mastering other languages becomes easy, once you have mastered C programming language. C is one of the most important of all programming languages. It is used to program desktop applications, compilers, tools and utilities and even hardware devices.C is a general-purpose programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs. C is often used for "system programming", including implementing operating systems and embedded system applications, due to a combination of desirable characteristics such as code portability and efficiency, ability to access specific hardware addresses, and low run-time demand on system resources. C can also be used for website programming using CGI as a "gateway" for information between the Web application, the server, and the browser. Some reasons for choosing C over interpreted languages are its speed, stability, and near-universal availability." ,"coursetalk"	"en"

"Children Acquiring Literacy Naturally"	"Information, Tech & Design Lecture 1: &nbsp;The course&nbsp;begins with the guiding proposal that universal
literacy can be achieved with minimal cost. It questions the commonly held belief that written language requires
formal instruction and schooling whereas spoken language is seamlessly acquired
from birth onward by natural interactions with persons who talk. This proposal
is followed by an overview of the scientific process because the research and
theory discussed in the class will consist of alternative perspectives and the
students will learn how different perspectives are developed and evaluated.
This process will enhance their critical thinking skills.

Lecture 2: There have been two primary theoretical
frameworks to describe language and its acquisition. The nativist position
holds that language and its acquisition are uniquely dependent on a considerable
amount of innate abilities, and unlike other perceptual and cognitive
functions. The empiricist position holds that very little, if any, of language
depends on innate abilities and its acquisition can be accounted for by typical
perceptual and cognitive processes. To evaluate these two theoretical
frameworks, we will learn about language structure, how it is used, and how it
is acquired.

Lectures 3 and 4: To set the stage for assessing the
possibility of naturally acquired reading, we will explore speech perception
and how it is acquired. Speech has also had two alternative theoretical
frameworks, and we will consider relevant research that addresses their
differences. The goal of this assessment is to better understand what is
required for speech perception and its acquisition and how these requirements
compare to the natural acquisition of reading.

Lectures 5 and 6: These lectures will give an overview of
research and theory on reading and literacy. Given the possibility of naturally
acquired reading, we will review the nature of reading and how it is currently
taught. One of the main goals is to destroy prevalent myths about how we read.
This discussion will highlight the assumptions in current practice and how they
compare to the possibility of naturally acquired reading.

Lecture 7: As covered in the previous lectures, it is
commonly believed that spoken and signed languages are acquired from birth
onward by natural interactions with persons who talk whereas learning to read
requires formal instruction and schooling. We consider the hypothesis that once
an appropriate form of written text is made available early in a child’s life
before formal schooling begins, reading will also be learned inductively,
emerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. We will
examine the role of perception and action modalities in language acquisition
and use and compare spoken and signed languages to written languages.

Lecture 8: We will describe the demographics of literacy and
illiteracy and their social and economic implications. The cost of illiteracy
as well as the huge cost of formal literacy instruction is one of the major
financial burdens on societies.

Lecture 9: We will study the implications of naturally
acquired literacy for individuals who are spoken and/or written language
challenged because of deafness or other impairments.

Lecture 10. We will review past technological developments
to set the stage for peering into the future. We will discuss the various technologies
available or soon to be available that will allow growing children to
experience an augmented reality that will be capable of supplementing their
real world experience with various forms of language generated automatically. Have recent developments in behavioral
science, neuroscience, and technology made it possible&nbsp;to achieve universal literacy with minimal cost? This course explores that important question.&nbsp;The lectures contemplate a revolutionary
new age that challenges the survival of our educational institutions and
society as we know them. Learn about current research and theory in language
acquisition, reading pedagogy, and wearable computing to assess the possibility
of an interactive system that would enable infants, toddlers, and preschool children to
acquire literacy naturally. This course will survey fundamental principles of language acquisition and learning to read. We will explore the possibility of becoming literate without formal schooling and instruction. No prior background in behavioral science, neuroscience, or technology is required." ,"Coursera"	"en"

"Practical Learning Analytics"	"Information, Tech & Design, Statistics and Data Analysis The menu:

Our smörgåsbord will include five
major courses, each offered in both small plate and full entrée sizes. Each
course will provide both a realistic data set and a set of example R code which
can be used to conduct the basic analyses we will discuss. Small plate users
will watch a few video lectures about their topic, complete a short quiz on the
content, download the data and R code, and run an analysis to answer some simple
questions. Users who choose the entrée will go further, extending the code in
both instructor-specified and student defined ways. The really ambitious will
repeat and extend these analyses using their own, local data. An introductory
video for each course will outline what it includes and provide some sense of
what users at each level will experience.

To keep the focus on the
practical, the five courses are designed to explore analyses of interest to
different audiences: students, instructors, department leaders, campus-wide
leaders, and course designers.

LA for students: How to become the student you
want to be? Exploring courses, majors, comparing your performance to others
realistically and richly.LA for instructors: Performance prediction in a
course: up to and including grade penalties, placement analyses, performance
disparities and their correlates, course-to-course correlationLA for department leaders: Persistence in a
major, first through short course sequences and then from intention to degreeLA for college/university leaders:
Characterizing the student experience, program evaluation – observing
differences and probing impact, capturing more and better information,
comparing the experience of different groups.LA for course designers: What affects
performance – behavior measurement, establishing the evidence basis for advice,
then acting to affect performance with technological and human behavior change
techniques, putting real-time data to work – early warning systems and
personalized communication Everyone involved in higher
education has questions. Students want to know how they’re doing and which
classes they should take. Faculty members want to understand their students’
backgrounds and to learn whether their teaching techniques are effective. Staff
members want to be sure the advice they provide is appropriate and find out whether
college requirements accomplish their goals. Administrators want to explore how
all of their students and faculty are doing and to anticipate emerging changes.
The public wants to know what happens in college and why.

Everyone has questions. We have
the chance to help them find answers. 

Learning analytics is about using
data to improve teaching and learning. You might wonder why there’s suddenly so
much conversation about this previously invisible topic.[1] After
all, institutions of higher education have maintained careful records of
student progress and outcomes for more than a century. &nbsp;They have always been ready to provide a
transcript for every student, reporting all courses taken, grades received,
honors awarded, and degrees conferred. Institutional research offices provide
summaries of these student records to campus leaders, accreditation agencies,
and the public. Why learning analytics now?

Two major trends drive the
current emergence of learning analytics. First, data informing teaching and
learning are increasingly extensive and accessible. Second, innovative new analytic
approaches to digesting, visualizing, and acting on these data emerge every day.What’s special about this
course?Practical Learning Analytics has a specific goal: to help us
collectively ponder learning analytics in a concrete way. To keep it practical,
we will focus on using traditional student record data, the kinds of data every
campus already has. To make it interesting, we will address questions raised by
an array of different stakeholders, including campus leaders, faculty, staff,
and especially students. To provide analytic teeth, each analysis we discuss
will be supported by both realistic data and sample code.Who should take this course?Practical Learning Analytics should provide something for anyone
interested in higher education: current, former, or future students, policy
makers, academic advisors, data scientists, university administrators, ed-tech
entrepreneurs, faculty members, even the curious public. This course has been designed to
work for a wide variety of audiences. Its structure is modeled on something
everyone can enjoy: a smörgåsbord –
we’re going to treat the class like one big meal. After we set the table, each
guest may wander the room, taking either a small plate or a full entrée from a
series of courses we offer up. When everyone is full, we’ll gather again over
coffee to hear what people thought. There is no defined way to pursue such a
meal – each diner chooses what’s right for them. And there is no defined way to
take this course – every student must choose what’s right for them.









The course will open with a two
week introduction, exploring the landscape of learning analytics in higher
education and setting the table for the main event. This is followed by a four
week meal during which participants may choose among an array of five different
topics, each presented at two levels: a small plate providing a quick
introduction, or a more filling entrée. Those choosing small plates will still have
the opportunity to work with realistic data, analyzing it with code we provide.
Those choosing entrées will make creative contributions of their own: writing
new code for analysis or visualization of the data we provide, perhaps bringing
in data of their own. After this month of exploration, the final two weeks will
feature a concluding coffee. In them, we’ll review what students learned while
wandering through all five courses, share the best things class members
invented, and provide some concluding remarks.

"The Beauty and Joy of Computing (CS Principles), Part 2"	"Computer Science The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a computer science principles course developed at the University of California, Berkeley, intended to broaden participation in computing to non-traditional groups. Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code.

This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us!
